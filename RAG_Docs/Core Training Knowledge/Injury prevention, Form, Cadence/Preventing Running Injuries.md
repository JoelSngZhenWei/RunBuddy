for Preventing Running Injuries in 
Singapore 

Each year, about 50% of runners face injuries, with nearly a quarter of those affecting the knee. While athletes often push through the pain, could this be our body's way of signaling that we need to address an issue before it worsens? Various factors contribute to injuries, including gender, running style, past injuries, and physical weaknesses. For instance, men are more prone to shin, ankle, and foot injuries, while women tend to experience more hip and knee discomfort. Our running mechanics can reveal which areas of our body may be weak and whether we are overstraining certain muscles or tendons. This article will explore how injuries happen and strategies for prevention. 
Common mistakes leading to injuries
Overtraining or poor training plan
Abruptly increasing the load or frequency of training without proper preparation can lead to injury. Our muscles are capable of handling their usual distance and training volume, but a sudden spike in demands can exceed their endurance. This results in subpar performance and puts additional stress on other structures, such as joints, tendons, or surrounding muscles. Furthermore, if there are existing weaknesses, muscles will tire more rapidly, causing adjacent muscles to overcompensate. This overexertion can lead to fatigue, inflammation, and weakness, ultimately resulting in injury.

Similarly, not allowing adequate recovery time for our muscles can have negative consequences. An increase in training frequency can leave muscles fatigued before a run, leading to weakness and, again, injury. It is no wonder that running injuries are so prevalent, especially as runners often strive to push their limits in training.

Ineffective running biomechanics
Examining our movement patterns can reveal where our weaknesses may be. If you consistently run with an altered gait, it can lead to stress on specific joints or muscles, resulting in either overuse or underuse of certain structures.

What causes our running gait to change?

This alteration can happen when a past injury has not been properly rehabilitated. The body compensates, and individuals often remain unaware of their altered gait until the overuse or underuse of these structures leads to long-term weaknesses and ultimately injury. Think about it: we typically only recognise there is an issue when we start to feel pain!

Wearing improper running shoes
Wearing inappropriate footwear while running can heighten the risk of injury due to several factors. Shoes that lack adequate arch support can lead to conditions such as plantar fasciitis or shin splints, while insufficient cushioning may result in joint pain from excessive impact. A poor fit, whether too tight or too loose, can cause blisters and negatively affect running form, thereby increasing the likelihood of injury. Furthermore, shoes designed for the wrong surface can compromise traction and stability, raising the risk of slips and falls. Worn-out shoes lose their protective qualities, making runners more vulnerable to various injuries. Therefore, it is important to select a suitable footwear tailored to individual needs and running conditions to ensure safe running practices.

Running on unsuitable surfaces
Running on hard surfaces, such as concrete or asphalt, poses an increased risk of injury due to the heightened  impact forces transmitted to the body with each stride. These rigid surfaces provide minimal shock absorption, which can lead to a range of issues, including joint pain, stress fractures, and tendonitis. The repetitive pounding on hard ground can exacerbate existing conditions and create discomfort in areas like the knees, hips, and lower back. Hard surfaces can reduce traction, increasing the risk of slips and falls, particularly in wet or uneven conditions. Consequently, while hard surfaces may be common in urban environments, runners need to be mindful of their impact on the body and consider cross-training or softer terrains to reduce the risk of injury.

These are the THREE most important areas to assess when doing a running assessment.
The Ankle
This has an impact on hip and knee position! Weakness in the tibialis posterior muscle, which generally decreases the arches in the foot, is the usual cause of overpronation, or rolling the foot inward. The ankle and knee might twist inward when the arches are lowered. Those with flat feet frequently experience this. When greater weight is applied to the lateral foot's border, underpronation happens, which causes the foot to slide outward. In an effort to maintain the ankle in neutral, this might cause the lateral ankle muscles to become overused. Lateral ankle sprains and lateral knee pain are frequently caused by weak lateral stabilisers, particularly the peroneal muscles.

The Knee
The knee can point inwards (valgus), or outwards (varus). Knee valgus will put pressure on the inside of the knee joint, often causing inflammation (patellofemoral or medial knee pain).

The glutes also have the function of stabilising and externally rotating the hip (turning out the leg). Should these be weak, the knee will move inwards because there would not be enough strength to turn the hip out.

Weak structures surrounding the kneecap, for example the inner thigh, cause knee valgus. The abductors (bring the leg out to the side) in this area are not strong enough to keep the knee in neutral so the leg is pulled inwards, putting pressure on the knee.

The Hip
Usually, the hip stabilises by contracting muscles surrounding the pelvis, making it strong enough to take all the weight on one leg when we are running (swing phase). When one side of the hip is higher than the other, this means that side if the hip is not taking all the weight that it should; indicating weakness. The hip is unstable and hence, our running is affected and often feels imbalanced.

How can running injuries be prevented in Singapore?
Preventing running injuries involves a combination of proper training, effective technique, and self-care practices. 

Warm up and cool-down
Always begin with a thorough warm-up to prepare your muscles and conclude with a cool-down to facilitate recovery. Integrating strength training exercises is essential for improving muscle balance and supporting your joints, with particular emphasis on the core, hips, and legs. Without rehabilitation input to strengthen an area or previous injury, this may only cause additional problems further down the line.

Focus on your running form
Maintain optimal running form; this entails keeping an upright posture, landing softly, and avoiding overstriding. It is important to engage your core muscles to provide stability and support, which can help prevent injuries. Swing your arms naturally, keeping them relaxed and close to your body to maintain balance and rhythm. Regularly practicing good form can enhance your efficiency and make running a more pleasurable activity.

Schedule rest days
Regular rest days are important for recovery and preventing burnout or injuries.  This allows your muscles to repair and grow stronger, while also giving your mind a much-needed break from the rigors of training. On rest days, consider engaging in gentle activities like yoga or a leisurely walk, which can promote relaxation and flexibility without straining your body.

Hydration and nourishment
Maintain good hydration and a balanced diet to support muscle recovery and overall performance. Adequate water intake helps to keep your body functioning optimally, while a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains provides essential nutrients and energy. Incorporating healthy fats, such as those found in avocados, nuts, and fish, can also aid in reducing inflammation and promoting heart health. 

Pay attention to your body
Do not ignore any signs of persistent pain; rest and consult a healthcare professional if needed. Regular check-ins with your health can prevent minor issues from escalating into more serious concerns. By taking proactive steps, you can foster a balanced and healthy lifestyle that supports your long-term goals and happiness.

How to handle injuries sustained while out on a run?
Respond appropriately to reduce damage and speed up healing if you hurt yourself while running. Here are steps to take:

Stop running immediately
Immediately cease activity to prevent further injury; attempting to persevere through the pain will likely worsen the condition.

Assess the injured area
Evaluate the severity of the injury. If it is a minor strain or sprain, self-management may be sufficient. However, if you experience severe pain, swelling, or an inability to move the affected area, it is advisable to seek medical attention.

Apply the R.I.C.E. method
Rest: Avoid placing weight on the injured area to facilitate healing.  

Ice: Apply ice packs for 15 to 20 minutes every hour to alleviate swelling and pain.  

Compression: Utilise a compression bandage to help minimise swelling.  

Elevation: Keep the injured area elevated above heart level to further reduce swelling.  

Over-the-counter pain medication
Medication such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help reduce pain and inflammation. To ensure the safe use of prescription or over-the-counter medications, it is advisable to consult with your doctor or pharmacist prior to administration.

Can physiotherapy help with running injuries in Singapore?
Physiotherapy treatments for running-related pain relief surround a range of approaches aimed at alleviating immediate discomfort while addressing underlying issues. 

Manual therapy techniques
These include joint mobilisation and soft tissue manipulation, help improve mobility and reduce tension in affected areas. 

Therapeutic exercises
These exercises target key muscle groups, such as the glutes and quadriceps, and include stretching routines to improve flexibility in the hips, calves, and hamstrings. 

Running analysis
A thorough running analysis can pinpoint faulty running mechanics, allowing for customised corrective strategies. 

Additional physiotherapy modalities
Other physiotherapy modalities like kinesiology taping, ultrasound therapy, and electrotherapy (including TENS), may be utilised to alleviate pain and promote healing. 

Ice and heat therapy further assist in managing inflammation and relaxing tight muscles. 

Patient education
Targeted education on roper running form, appropriate footwear selection, and ergonomic training techniques is essential for preventing future injuries. 

Gradual return-to-activity plan
This ensures that runners safely increase their intensity and volume, thereby reducing the risk of re-injury.

By adhering to these practices, you can improve your running experience while minimising the risk of injuries. We hope these tips will enhance your enjoyment of each run. Remember, the journey to becoming a better runner is a personal one, and it is important to listen to your body and progress at your own pace. Celebrate each milestone, no matter how small. Whether you are running for health, competition, or simply the joy of it, each step forward is a victory. Lace up those shoes, head out the door, and enjoy every stride you take on this wonderful journey!
