If you have not been active and have not engaged in regular physical activity for a
while, it is important that you assess your present fitness level and health condition.

However, if you have a medical condition such as heart disease, high blood pressure,
diabetes or asthma, not all forms of physical activity may be suitable for you. Check
with your doctor or a fitness professional on the type, intensity and duration of physical
activity that you can start with.

How Many Times a Week to Exercise

You can start with simple moderate-intensity activities such as brisk walking, cycling or
swimming three to four times a week. These activities are generally safe for everyone
and the risk of injury is low. The key to sustaining your interest in any workout routine is
to choose activities that you will enjoy.

Engage in different types of exercise or physical activities and aim for at least 150 to
300 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activities and at least 2 days of strength

training every week to build up your aerobic fitness and strengthen your muscles. It
may seem a daunting task with your busy lifestyles but every little bit counts.

You can include physical activity into your daily routine and even engage in some of
your other favourite activities while you exercise. For example, you can jog with your

doa or watch TV while evclina on a statinnarv exercise hike

Be flexible with your timing. You don't have to do all your physical activity at one go. If
you cannot set aside 30 minutes a day for your exercise routine, break it up into smaller
bouts. You can gain health benefits even by doing shorter but more frequent activities
throughout the day.

You can even incorporate the sessions into a mode of transport where you could cycle
to work or stop a few bus stops earlier and brisk walk home!

How to Start an Exercise Routine

When starting an exercise programme, always start slow. Your body needs time to
adjust to the increased physical activity, especially if you have not been active. This will
help to prevent injuries and the potential onset of muscle soreness.

You can subsequently increase the intensity and duration of your activity as your
fitness level improves.

Always do warm-ups and cool down properly before and after a session of physical
activity.

Warm your muscles up by doing your activity at a slower speed or lower intensity. For
example, before your jogging session, you could walk briskly to warm up.

After your activity, cool down by performing gentle stretches. This helps to improve
flexibility and prevent aches.

Keep the Physical Activity Going

To sustain your interest and make active lifestyle your way of life, apply the following
tips:

e Explore new activities with your family, friends or colleagues to keep the interest
going and help you stay motivated.

e Pick up new sports or activities to inject variety such as ballroom dancing, yoga and
kickboxing.
