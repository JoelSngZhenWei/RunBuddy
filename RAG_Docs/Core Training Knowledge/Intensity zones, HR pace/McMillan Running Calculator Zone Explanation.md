# McMillan Running Calculator Zone Explanation

## Page 1

Once I started training for races and hanging out with more experienced runners, I realized there are different types of runs that target different energy systems and fitness goals. I heard terms like “long runs,” “tempo runs,” “speed workouts,” and even strange names like “fartleks.” It was all Greek to me at first!

But over time, I came to understand that runners and coaches organize workouts into different training “zones” based on intensity and duration. This systematization helps ensure you train all the energy systems for optimal race-day performance.

While there’s no universal system, I’ve adopted a simple four-zone model from scientist Dr. David Martin that focuses on the primary fitness goal of each zone:

Zone 1: Endurance Building an aerobic base
Zone 2: Stamina-Boosting lactate threshold
Zone 3: Speed: Developing VO2 max
Zone 4: Sprint: Improving neuromuscular power
Within each zone are several workouts that target the zone’s fitness goal. So let’s break down the zones and popular workouts:

Zone 1: Endurance
The endurance zone should comprise 60–80% of your weekly training. Going slow to go fast later is the name of the game here.

Endurance runs are continuous efforts lasting from 30 minutes up to several hours, performed at an easy-moderate pace where you can carry a conversation.

Popular Endurance Zone workouts include:

Easy Runs: Your regular 30-90 minute runs
Long runs: continuous efforts over 90 minutes. Long runs longer than 2 hours provide unique physiological adaptations.
Recovery Jogs: short, slower jogs for active rest between hard efforts or after intense/long workouts

Zone 2: Stamina
As you increase intensity, you’ll cross an effort level called the lactate threshold, where lactic acid overwhelms your clearance capacity. The Stamina Zone focuses on pushing this threshold pace faster through workouts like:

Steady State Runs: 25–75 continuous minutes at ~10 sec/mile under lactate threshold pace
Tempo Runs: 15–30 continuous minutes right at lactate threshold pace
Tempo Intervals: 8–15 minutes at threshold pace, broken into repeats with a 2–5 minute jog rest
Cruise Intervals: 3–8 minutes at threshold effort with 30 seconds to 2 minutes of jog rest
You’ll be working too hard here to speak in sentences, but should still get out a few words between breaths.

Zone 3: Speed
Entering the Speed Zone, you start focusing on your maximum aerobic capacity, known as VO2 Max. These are those lung-busting track repeats!

Speed workouts last 1–5 minutes per interval, performed at a 5k–1500m race pace with equal or shorter jog rest intervals. The surging pace and incomplete rest floods muscles with lactate, training your buffering capacity.

I like to break up the monotony with fartlek runs. Effort and terrain can dictate speed instead of distance and time.

Zone 4: Sprint
The final zone targets your fastest neuromuscular speed through workouts like:

Sprint Intervals: 10-400 meters at mile race pace or faster with very long 4-5x jog rest
Strides: controlled 15-20 second accelerations focusing on form and leg turnover with 30-90 second jog rest
This zone is tough! You’ll be breathing extremely hard. But the result is improved speed, endurance, and a killer finishing kick.

Mix It Up!
Not all runs fit neatly into one zone. Workouts often combine zones, just like races do. Experiment to find your perfect recipe!

I hope this breakdown demystifies running zones and workouts for you. Understanding the purpose behind each session helps you train smarter and get more from your running.

Now lace up and hit a long run—that endurance zone base won’t build itself!

What is the primary focus of training in the endurance zone?
The primary focus of training in the endurance zone is building an aerobic base through continuous efforts lasting from 30 minutes to several hours at an easy-moderate pace.

How do tempo runs differ from steady-state runs in the stamina zone?
Tempo runs are performed at lactate threshold pace for 15–30 continuous minutes, while steady state runs are longer efforts (25–75 minutes) at a slightly slower pace, about 10 seconds per mile under lactate threshold pace.

What’s the purpose of training in the Speed Zone?
The purpose of training in the Speed Zone is to focus on improving maximum aerobic capacity, known as VO2 Max, through interval workouts lasting 1–5 minutes per interval at a 5k–1500m race pace with equal or shorter jog rest intervals.

How do sprint intervals in the Sprint Zone help improve a runner’s performance?
Sprint intervals in the Sprint Zone, which involve 10-400 meter repetitions at mile race pace or faster with very long 4-5x jog rest, help improve a runner’s speed, endurance, and finishing kick by targeting their fastest neuromuscular speed.

Can workouts combine different training zones?
Yes, not all runs fit neatly into one zone. Workouts often combine zones, just like races do, and runners can experiment to find their perfect recipe for training across the different zones.
