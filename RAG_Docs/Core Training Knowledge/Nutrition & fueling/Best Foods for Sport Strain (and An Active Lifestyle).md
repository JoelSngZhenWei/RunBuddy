# Best Foods for Sport Strain (and An Active Lifestyle)

## Page 1
For active individuals, getting a strain here or injury there may be quite unavoidable. From not warming up properly or sufficiently, to on-field risks, to even dehydration or excessive exercise, these are common causes of sport strain or injury.

Common ailments include – but are not limited to – abrasion, dislocation, fracture, inflammation and sprain. Some are detected instantly, while others may start from being negligible or minor but deteriorate if unnoticed or left untreated.

While we may not be able to go risk-free, being active adults can definitely boost our bodies and help us stay in better form for our active lifestyle and speedier recovery. Giving more attention to our dietary choices is one way to achieve this.
