BODY BATTERY™ ENERGY MONITORING

The Body Battery feature on your Garmin watch is designed to help you monitor your personal energy resources around the clock. Powered by Firstbeat Analytics™, Body Battery energy monitoring makes the combined influences of physical activity, stress, rest and the restorative power of sleep visible in a powerful way. Use this perspective to make smarter exercise decisions and form healthy habits based on what works best for you.

Compatible Garmin devices take your Body Battery experience to the next level with personalized insight into the most influential moments of your day1. These events combined with dynamic feedback translate into an opportunity to master the often-complex relationship between lifestyle, health and fitness.

YOUR BODY BATTERY EXPERIENCE
You can expect your Body Battery to be fullest in the morning when you wake up. Activity and stress combine to drain your energy throughout the day, while naps and restful moments can slow things down or even give you a boost. A good night’s sleep is your ultimate recharge opportunity, although illness, alcohol consumption and residual stress can prevent you from fully charging overnight.

Engaging experiences and challenging activities are essential parts of a healthy lifestyle. When you have energy, use it. Get some exercise. Tackle projects and get things done. These efforts drain your available energy but set the stage for long-term success by improving your fitness and building resiliency.

Try to be kind to yourself when your energy levels are low. Taking on more than you can handle makes it harder to bounce back stronger. Getting enough rest maximizes the benefits of your workouts and supports general well-being. That said, avoid making a habit of ending the day with lots of energy in reserve. An easy day can be beneficial sometimes, but too many easy days can lead to lower fitness and coping abilities.

HOW YOUR BODY BATTERY WORKS
The Body Battery feature works by continuously analyzing combinations of heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and movement data while you wear your device. The goal of this analysis is to identify meaningful physiological states and to describe the impact they have on your body’s energy levels. At a high level, this means documenting if you are awake or asleep, when you are physically active and tracking stress levels during periods of inactivity.

DAILY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE DRAIN YOUR BATTERY
When you are physically active, the intensity of your activity affects how quickly your Body Battery drains. Specifically, vigorous exercise depletes your daily energy levels faster than lighter efforts. The duration of your activity also counts. A long, hard workout will have a much bigger draining effect on your Body Battery than a short walk.

Recording your activities with your device allows your Body Battery to supply deeper insight into how specific activities affected you. This includes more information about the health and fitness benefits of your activities and how the timing and strenuousness of your activities affect your sleep.

STRESS DRAINS YOUR BATTERY. REST CHARGES IT.
Your physiological stress levels influence Body Battery charging and draining patterns outside of exercise and daily physical activity. Stress is your body’s natural response to the challenges of life and environment. It is simply an elevated state of excitement, alertness or readiness for action measured outside of physical activity. Stressors, or causes of stress, can be internal or external, and they can be highly personal. This is why it helps to have a device capable of helping monitor your own situation.

Garmin all-day stress tracking continuously measures your physiological stress on a scale from 0 to 100. Stress levels below 25 are classified as rest, a state associated with parasympathetic dominance of your autonomic nervous system and recovery. Stress levels above 25 reflect sympathetic dominance of your autonomic nervous system with the degree of dominance increasing as your stress levels rise.

Stress is often associated with negative emotions such as anxiety and feelings of inadequacy, but it can also accompany more positive emotions such as eager anticipation and big-day jitters. Regardless of why you are experiencing stress and accompanying emotions, stress has a draining effect on your energy levels, and higher stress levels will drain your energy reserves more quickly.

Your body needs rest. The energy you need to be at your best accumulates during restful moments of inactivity and while you sleep. Taking a nap can give your Body Battery a boost, but a good night’s sleep is the single greatest opportunity to recharge.

STRESS LEVEL	BODY BATTERY	ANS DOMINANCE	HR TYPICALLY	HRV
0–25 (rest)	Charging	Parasympathetic	Lower	Higher
25–100	Draining	Sympathetic	Higher	Lower
How relaxed you are determines the strength of your Body Battery charge effect. A lower resting heart rate and higher HRV compared to your personal baseline are good indicators of effective resting. Even lower stress levels can inhibit your body’s restorative processes.

SLEEP AND NAPS
Sleep plays an especially important and unique role in restoring the energy you need to thrive. Body Battery energy monitoring complements Garmin sleep-related insights with a 24-hour perspective that links night and day. Stress levels still regulate your Body Battery during sleep, but the fact that you are sleeping makes a difference.

Sleep pressure is a concept used to account for the fact that your body’s need for sleep increases with how long you have been awake. The technical term for this natural phenomenon is homeostatic sleep drive. Compatible Garmin devices use this insight to enhance your Body Battery experience.

Sleep pressure starts to accumulate when you wake up. It builds steadily throughout the day and starts to dissipate when you go to sleep. The consistent draining force of sleep pressure can outweigh the charging effect of lighter resting moments. This means that your Body Battery is not automatically increasing just because you are resting. A full night of good-quality sleep will fully restore the energy drain resulting from sleep pressure accumulation. A short night’s sleep after a long day can mean the effects of accumulated sleep pressure will linger until you catch up on your sleep needs.

HOW FITNESS AFFECTS YOUR BODY BATTERY
Taking a moment to understand how your fitness level can influence your Body Battery will set you up for success down the road. To master this relationship, it is important to appreciate the difference between physical activity (i.e., exercise) and fitness. These closely related concepts affect your Body Battery in somewhat opposite ways, depending on whether you are looking at daily results or the big picture.

Your fitness level can be easily measured in terms of VO2 max, which reflects how well your heart, lungs, circulatory system and muscles all work together to support aerobic energy production. The best way to improve your fitness is with regular exercise performed at vigorous intensity levels.

Exercise drains your Body Battery according to the intensity of your efforts. Higher intensity efforts drain your Body Battery faster than lower intensity efforts. However, as your fitness level improves, exercise and stressful experiences have a smaller relative impact on your body, and your resiliency tends to improve.

In other words, better fitness translates into a better ability to manage stress and to perform more exercise without getting completely wiped out. This reality is built into the Body Battery feedback that your Garmin device provides. So, although daily workouts will deplete your body’s energy resources, the long-term benefit is a net positive.

LOW BODY BATTERY: CAUSE FOR CONCERN?
Life is full of ups, downs and surprises. Rarely do we have full control over when challenges will appear. There will always be times when work needs to be done — despite your energy levels running low. Sometimes you just need to grit your teeth and go, but going through life perpetually on empty can lead to a variety of health issues. It’s also an undeniable recipe for falling short of your potential.

With that in mind, the occasional low-energy day is no cause for alarm, especially if you have a clear understanding of why you are in that situation. Are you getting sick? Did you have a bad night’s sleep? Are you pushing yourself to meet a deadline? These circumstances will pass, and soon you’ll be feeling back to normal. However, if you find your Body Battery is perpetually low, it might be time to start looking for areas to improve.

Knowledge is power, and it’s worth knowing that being low on energy doesn’t mean you can’t exercise. You may struggle to complete your workout, but you can probably muddle your way through. But just because you can doesn’t mean you should. The downside of banging out a tough workout with a low battery is that in the long term, your efforts may ultimately be counterproductive.

The benefits or gains you can expect from training come in the form of physiological adaptations in response to challenges. Keep in mind that working out when you are worn down, haven’t slept or have been experiencing excessive stress loads means that your body likely won’t achieve the maximum benefit.
