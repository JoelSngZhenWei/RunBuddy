# The Association of Sleep Duration and Quality with Heart Rate Variability and Blood Pressure

## Page 1
Background: The current study was conducted to evaluate the relation of sleep
duration and quality with blood pressure (BP) and heart rate variability (HRV).
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 2017
among 260 staff of a university hospital in Isfahan, Iran. They were selected by
multi-stage random method from different wards. Time domain spectral
analysis was used to measure a number of HRV parameters. The long-term
components of the HRV were estimated using the standard deviation of the
normal-to-normal interval (SDNN). The square root of the mean squared
differences of successive NN intervals (RMSSD) was calculated by statistical
time domain measurements; SNN50, and PNN50 were measured. Pittsburg
sleep quality index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality.
Results: Higher PSQI score correlated with lower SDANN rise (OR=0.92).
Fairly bad to very good subjective sleep quality had association with lower
SDANN (OR=0.43). Very high sleep latency to very low sleep latency ratio had
association with lower SDANN (OR=0.39) and lower PNN50 (OR= 0.44). Sleep
duration and HRV parameters had no significant association. Fairly bad sleep
efficiency to very good sleep efficiency ratio was correlated with lower SDANN
(OR= 0.29). Very high daytime dysfunction to very low daytime dysfunction
ratio had correlation with lower SDANN (OR=0.35). Very bad compared to
very good subjective sleep quality had significant correlation with higher Heart
rate (HR) (B=0.03). Very high sleep latency compared to no sleep latency was
associated with higher HR (B=4.74). Very high compared to very low amount of
sleep disturbances correlated with higher SBP levels (B=15.2). Using sleep
medication less than once a week compared with no history of taking such
drugs was associated with higher HR (B=16.4).
Conclusion: Our findings showed that poor sleep quality are adversely
associated with HRV, HR and BP. This finding should be considered in clinical
and preventive recommendations.

INTRODUCTION
Sleep, as a physiological resting state, is seriously in
correlation with human being health as its process needs a
variety of molecular and organ biological regulation and
integrity (1, 2). This mental and physical resting state is
required for healthy functioning of human being
including behavioral, developmental and intellectual
functioning (1, 3, 4).
Mammals including human beings spend at least one
third of their lifetime sleeping. This fact may strongly 
## Page 3
reflect the fundamental process of sleeping and its effects
on different body organs, while long ago it was considered
that sleeping is only a body quite state (2, 4).
Variety of medullar, cortical and subcortical neural
network cooperation as well as hormonal and co-ordinated
neurotransmission secretion are needed to maintain sleep
quality. In addition to the mentioned factors, the
Autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a key role during
sleep process and is responsible for cardiovascular
function variability during sleeping including its onset and
stage transitions (4, 5).
Beat-to-beat modulation of Heart rate (HR) occurs via
ANS activity by Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and
Parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) discharges through
sympathetic and vagal innervations of the heart,
respectively (6, 7).
Heart rate variability (HRV) during sleeping is a great
matter of debate. Although it is known that HR would
decrease during sleep, this overall pattern is influenced
with body circadian temperature, stage of sleep, body
movements and awakenings. It is confirmed that during
non-rapid eye movement stage (NREM) of sleep,
parasympathetic cardiac innervations is more active and
cardiovascular system is stable, while during REM stage,
cardiovascular system is steeply affected by sympathetic
system (8, 9).
Studies have confirmed that sleep deprivation can
affect persons' cardiovascular system functions negatively
and also may be associated with hypertension in future in
both adults and children (6, 10, 11). In addition, reduced
HRV has been shown to be in association with
cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, it has been confirmed
that HRV abnormality is independently a mortality risk
factor (7, 12).
The goal of this study is to evaluate the association of
sleep duration and quality with Blood pressure (BP) and
HRV.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The current cross-sectional study was performed
among the staff of Alzahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran.
Sampling was done in a multi-stage random method based
on the different wards of the hospital. Total population of
the study was 260. All participants were asked about
medication use and diseases. Participants with a history of
major medical and psychiatric disorder or drug
consumption were omitted from the study. Prior to the
HRV measurements, the individuals under study were
asked to answer a questionnaire on their demographic data
and life habits (e.g., smoking, coffee drinking, and
exercise). The measurement tool was Arshia Crown Teb
(ACT) and software was Cardiorhythm A.C.T V3.7b.
Data analysis was performed using STATA (version
11.0, STATA Corp, College Station, TX, USA). Informed
consent was given by all participants.
Data gathering methods:
Blood pressure: (13)
BP measurement was done while participants were
calm and in a sitting position for 30 minutes. BP was
measured twice with a standardized and calibrated
mercury sphygmomanometer from the right arm. The
interval between two measurements was five minutes. An
average of two measurements for systolic and diastolic BP
were recorded.
Hypertension was diagnosed in participants based on
the 90th percentile of the distribution of SBP and/or DBP
with accordance to gender, age, and height.
Heart rate variability:
The subjects were prohibited from alcohol and caffeine
consumption after 10 p.m. (22:00) on the night before the
HRV measurements. In addition, smokers were asked to
avoid smoking in the hour before the measurements. To
control diurnal variation, HRV measurement was
performed between 8 a.m. (08:00) and 12 a.m. (12:00).
Electrodes were placed on each subject’s wrists and left
foot to derive HRV for 5 min, while sitting comfortably on
a chair and breathing ordinarily.
The HRV parameters measured by time domain
spectral analysis included the following: The standard
deviation of the normal-to-normal interval (SDNN) used to
estimate long-term components of the HRV, and the
square root of the mean squared differences of successive
NN intervals (RMSSD) acquired by statistical time domain
measurements. SNN50, and PNN50 were measured among
the participants.

Assessment of sleep quality:
Assessment of sleep quality was done among
participants using the Pittsburg sleep quality index (PSQI)
questionnaire. Each participant was instructed to fill in
questions regarding their respective subjective sleep
quality, sleep duration, sleep latency, habitual sleep
efficiency, use of sleeping medication, sleep disturbances
and daytime dysfunction as the 7 components of the
Pittsburg index.
RESULTS
Of all 260 participants, 114 (43.8%) were males. Mean
age (SD) was 38.5(13.3) years and mean BMI was 25(4.6)
Kg/m2. Mean sleep duration among participants was
6.1(1.7) hours a day. 105 of the participants had poor
quality sleep. Mean heart rate was 85.1 in females and 79.2
in males. Systolic and diastolic BP was not significantly
different among males and females. Mean (SD) PSQI global
score was 5.9(3.5) and 7.3(3.7) in males and females,
respectively (Table 1).
The tertiles of SDANN, RMSSD, SNN50 and PNN50
are presented in Table 2. As presented in Table 3, higher
PSQI score was associated with lowering the chance of
SDANN rise (OR=0.92). Fairly bad to very good subjective
sleep quality ratio was associated with lower SDANN
amount (OR=0.43). Very high sleep latency to very low
sleep latency ratio was significantly associated with lower
SDANN amount (OR=0.39) and also with lower PNN50
amount (OR= 0.44). A significant relationship between
sleep duration and HRV parameters was not found. Fairly
bad sleep efficiency to very good sleep efficiency ratio was
also correlated with lower SDANN amount (OR= 0.29).
Very high daytime dysfunction to very low daytime
dysfunction ratio was significantly associated with lower
SDANN amount (OR=0.35). Linear regression predicting
SBP, DBP and MHR parameters by sleep data showed that
very bad compared to very good subjective sleep quality
correlated significantly with higher HR among participants
(B=0.03). Moreover, very high sleep latency was compared
to no sleep latency, correlating with higher HR (B=4.74). In
the crude model sleep duration of less than 5 hours
compared to more than 7 hours was associated with higher
SBP levels (B=7.3); even though this relationship was not
significant after adjusting for age, sex and BMI. Very high
compared to very low amount of sleep disturbances was
associated with higher SBP levels in participants (B=15.2).
As presented in Table 4, using sleep medication (less than
once a week) as compared with no history of taking such
drugs was associated with higher HR (B=16.4).

DISCUSSION
According to our study, poor sleep quality is adversely
associated with HRV, HR and BP. The association of sleep
and HRV has been a matter of debate. It is known that
heart rate decreases during sleep and generally follows the
circadian curve of body temperature. However, within this
overall pattern, heart rate is also related to sleep stage,
awakenings, and body movements. Sleep stages alternate
throughout a normal sleep period and correlate with
changes in HRV. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM)
## Page 7
sleep stage, the cardiovascular system is stable and
parasympathetic cardiac modulation is stronger. During
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage, the cardiovascular
system is unstable and greatly influenced by surges in
sympathetic activity (8, 14-16). In an old study conducted
by Zemaityte et al. in 1984, HRV and respiratory changes
in limited number of healthy subjects during their sleep
were assessed. They found that during REM stage of sleep
HR would increase, but generally HRV was dependent on
basal autonomic activity of each patient (17). Crasset et al.
evaluated the aging effect on HRV during sleep. They
reported that during Non-REM sleep, old people had
shorter RR intervals and lower HRV compared to young
subjects (18).
Stress is a factor that has been considered as a risk of
sleep disturbances and thus may affect persons' autonomic
function during sleeping and influence HRV during
sleeping. Previous studies have presented that acute stress
can cause autonomic dysfunction during sleep. In fact
healthy cases who were facing stressful conditions were
struggling with decreased parasympathetic modulation
during both REM and non-REM phases of their sleep. In
addition they were struggling with increased
sympathovagal balance disturbances during their nonREM phase of sleep. In agreement with our study, in one
published study based on polysomnography HRV was
increased in association with poor sleep maintenance and
sleep disturbances (19). In another study conducted by
Davidson et al. (20), sleep disturbances of residents of areas
with presentation of chronic stress was assessed and
compared with normal population as controls. They found
modest association of sleep disturbances with stressful life
and concluded that basal stress could be considered as a
possible factor, but may not play the main role in sleep
disturbances (20). There are large number of further
studies in which they have concluded that stress and
negative thoughts can affect sleep onset and also quality
(21, 22). We did not measure stress level in our study, but
our findings were in complete agreement with these
previous studies.
Sleep problems could result in autonomic imbalance as
well, but presentations of previous studies are
controversial (6). In a study conducted by Holmes et al.
showed that an acute deprivation of sleeping was
accompanied with decreased cardiac sympathetic activity
while parasympathetic activity did not change (23). These
findings were inconsistent with the study conducted by Xu
Zhong et al. that found increased sympathetic and reduced
parasympathetic activity following 36 hours of sleep
deprivation (24). A more recent investigation of the effects
of sleep deprivation on autonomic regulation found that
sleep deprivation predicted an increase in vagal tone (25).
Our finding in this study shows both sympathetic and
parasympathetic activity changes with sleep duration.
Higher HR and lower HRV during sleep are considered
as independent risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. In
fact cardiac autonomic dysregulation is considered as risk
factor of cardiovascular diseases during awakenings and
also sleeping. This is mentioned in study of Brosschot et al.
that low HRV is accompanied with higher risks of
morbidity and mortality (21). Another study assessed
sleep disturbances among males with metabolic syndrome
and sleep apnea; they presented that diurnal pattern of
sympathovagal imbalance among these cases- due to their
nocturnal sleep disturbances- is accompanied with
parasympathetic loss during sleep and decreased HRV. In
fact, they concluded that reduced HRV is independent of
underlying obstructive sleep apnea and accompanied with
higher morbidity and mortality in this group (26).
The association of ANS and BP has been known for a
long time. SNS raises the BP; whereas PNS lowers it.
Studying both HR and BP fluctuations is known to be a
method for investigating the ANS (27). Moreover, the
association of sleep and BP has been studied before. Sleep
in healthy humans is associated with a decrease in HR, BP,
and sympathetic activity; whereas it seems that it is
associated with increased parasympathetic activity (28).
Experimental data suggest that reducing sleep length may
result in adverse responses, such as an increase in HR (28).
Sleep problems could result in autonomic imbalance as

well, for instance by increasing the dominance of
sympathetic activity over parasympathetic modulation (6).
Previously it has been presented that sleep deprivation can
cause hypertension in normal population. The study of
Robillard et al. found that sleep duration of seven-hours-aday and less is accompanied with hypertension. They
stated that in case of less than six-hours-a-day sleeping,
this association would be more steeply. This study
confirms the influence of sleep duration on BP (29).
Various mechanisms such as the association of sleep
duration and hypothalamic–pituitary– adrenal axis and
also renin–angiotensin system have been suggested as the
causal link between sleep duration and hypertension (28).
Kuciene and Dulskiene (30) found that short sleep duration
was associated with higher BP, while other studies
reported a positive (31) or no association (32) between
sleep duration and BP.
Previous investigations have presented that cases with
sleep disorders are prone to hypertension. Studies on cases
with breathing disorders have mentioned this association
overtly, as this hypertension may have occurred due to
their underlying breathing disorder regardless of their
sleep disorders (29). Other studies conducted on normal
populations have presented that cases complaining from
low quality of their sleep are highly prone to hypertension
(33). Moreover, Bruno et al. presented that cases with
hypertension who were resenting from low quality sleep
were significantly more prone to poor BP treatment
response (34).
Our study had some limitations including that we did
not exclude obstructive sleep apnea as a confounding
factor. The cross-sectional nature of the study is another
limitation. Repeated recordings of HRV in different times
of the day would be analytically more valuable. The lack of
a control group was also a flaw in this study. Its strength is
the novelty of the variables studied.
CONCLUSION
Our finding showed that poor sleep quality is
adversely associated with HRV, HR and BP. This finding
should be considered in clinical and preventive
recommendations.
