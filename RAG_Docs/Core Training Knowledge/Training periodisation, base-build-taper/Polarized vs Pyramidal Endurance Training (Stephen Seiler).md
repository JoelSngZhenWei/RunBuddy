# Polarized and pyramidal training intensity distributions in distance running: an integrative literature review

## Page 1
This study aims to investigate the differences and similarities between the polarized and pyramid-intensity training methods described in the literature as the most typical training methods for elite international distance runners (1500- 10,000 m). Material and
Methods: 26 literature articles analyzing the training intensity distribution of international
distance runners were found after a review of internet databases. Results: In both training
methods, elite track runners cover an average of 120-180 km per week, 75-80% of which
is done at low intensity, below the aerobic threshold (vLT1). In the pyramid method, runners
perform interval or continuous tempo running workouts at speeds below the anaerobic
threshold (vLT2) on average 2-4 times per week. In contrast, in the polarized intensity distribution, interval training is performed on average 1 time per week above the anaerobic
threshold at 90% of vVo2max. Intensities near race speed are performed as short intervals
(< 800m) during the base period. Conclusions: The training of modern distance runners is
characterized by an emphasis on the development of aerobic capacity, achieved primarily
through high amounts of low-intensity work and 1-4 anaerobic threshold training sessions
per week. Athletes use short intervals and short sprints to maintain their anaerobic abilities
and their coordination at race speed. They start using longer, intensive race-specific work
in the period leading up to races. During the racing season, runners maintain endurance
with a significant amount of low-intensity running and less pronounced anaerobic threshold training.

Introduction
Over the past decades, there have been numerous publications in the international literature on the physiological, anthropometric, and
morphological factors that are essential for successful performance in middle and long-distance
running (Kovács, Kóbor, Sebestyén and Tihanyi,
2021). In terms of physiological factors, these
are maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), running
economy (RE), and velocity associated with maximal oxygen uptake (vVo2max) (Noakes Myburgh
and Schall, 1990; Noakes, 2001, Conley and Krahenbuhl, 1980). In addition to these factors, the
anaerobic threshold and associated running speed
(vAt) are the best predictors of distance running
performance (Tjelta, Tjelta and Drystad, 2012).
Since the beginning of the last century, training
methods to improve these abilities have been continuously improved based on empirical observations by coaches. A consensus has emerged among
coaches and researchers that interaction between
three main factors plays a role in the development
of these parameters: training volume (number of
kilometers over a given period), training density,
and training intensity (Foster, Daniels and Seiler,
1999; Midgley, McNaughton and Jones, 2007; Brandon, 1995). However, these combinations may
vary from one event to another, from one athlete
to another (Seiler and Tonessen, 2009). There may
also be variations in the training tool that coaches
use to achieve a given physiological adaptation.
The literature uses different intensity-zone-based
schemes to classify the training performed by endurance athletes (Seiler and Kjerland, 2006). The
most widely used is the 3-zone scale associated
with the name Stephen Seiler (see Table 1.) (Seiler,
2010). Here, work below the aerobic threshold
(vLT1) is classified as Low-Intensity Training
(LIT), between the aerobic and anaerobic thresholds (vLT1 and vLT2) as Moderate Intensity Training (MIT), and above the anaerobic threshold as
High-Intensity Training (HIT). In addition to the
above-mentioned scales, 5-zone (Tjelta, 2016) and
9-zone scales (Haugen, Sandbakk, Enoksen, Seiler
and Tonnessen, 2021) for middle-distance runners
are also used. These are mainly based on physiological parameters (aerobic and anaerobic threshold) (Seiler, 2010), but some researchers also suggest the use of pace relative to race pace (Kenneally,
Casado, Gomez-Ezeiza and Santos Concejero, 2020;
Kelemen, Benczenleitner and Tóth, 2023a). The
training intensity distribution (TID) is the most
commonly distinguished training method used in
research:
• Traditional/ Pyramidal distribution: most
of the training volume (around 70-80%) is
done at low intensity (Zone 1). The remaining
20-30% is at medium to high intensity, such
that there is more medium intensity (Zone 2/
Anaerobic threshold training) and less of the
highest intensity (Zone 3). As the workloads
get higher, the amount of work done by the
runner decreases, so, a pyramid is drawn.
• Polarized training: in the method described
by Stephen Seiler (Seiler and Kjerland, 2004),
athletes perform large amounts of low-intensity
(Zone 1 ~ 80%) and high-intensity (Zone 3 ~
20%) work, while very little or no effort is performed at moderate intensity (Zone 2). A Polarization Index (PI): PI=log₁₀ (Z1/Z2 x Z3*100)
calculus was created by Treff and his co-workers
to determine whether the training intensity distribution counts as Polarized, where Polarized if
PI > 2.00 a.U. (Treff, Winkert, Sareban, Steinacker and Sperlich, 2019).
• Anaerobic threshold training/ Threshold
training: in contrast to the other two methods, the majority of training (>35%) takes
place in Zone 2, which is associated with the
anaerobic threshold, but here too the majority
of work (60-62%) is performed at low intensity (Zone 1). However, this latter method is
not typical of the ascent of professional international distance runners, according to the
work of Casado et al. (Casado, González-Mohíno, González-Ravé and Foster, 2022).

10,000 m are dominated by aerobic energy expenditure (Gastin, 2001), their training shows a homogeneous picture. However, the preparation of 800
m athletes, differs from these longer events (Haugen et al., 2021). For the shorter distance of 1500
m, 75-80% of the energy is derived from aerobic
energy, while for the 10 km, 95% is derived from
aerobic energy. The races’ energy production differences are also reflected in their pacing (Tucker,
Lambert and Noakes, 2006; Kelemen, Csányi, Révész, Gyimes, Benczenleitner and Tóth, 2023b; Filipas,
Nerli, Bonato, La Torre and Piacentini, 2018).

Several studies have been published on different
intensity-based approaches. Some of these were
short-term and focused on local, amateur-level
athletes (Filipas, Bonato, Gallo and Godella, 2022).
In the literature on the training of elite athletes,
examples of both polarised and pyramidal distributions can be found, so different approaches appear to be used to achieve similar levels of results
in distance runners (Kenneally, Casado, GomezEzeiza and Santos Concejero, 2020; Tjelta, 2013;
Tjelta, 2016; Ingham, Fudge and Pringle, 2012;
Seiler, 2010). In the present study, we have sought
to explain the phenomenon of how it is possible
to achieve similar results with seemingly two different approaches, and what are the key training
elements that enable this high level of endurance
performance. Finally, how these observations can
be put to use in practical preparation.
Aim
The literature on the subject shows that at the
highest level, the training of elite international
distance runners (1500-10,000m) is mainly characterised by Polarised and Pyramidal intensity distribution methods (Foster, Casado, Esteve-Lanao,
Haugen and Seiler, 2022; Casado et al., 2022). For
this reason, the aim of this study is to investigate
the differences and similarities between these two
methods. The study investigated the following
aspects: training volume, intensity distribution,
training tools and periodization. A further aim of
the research is to draw conclusions from the training of elite athletes that can be used by coaches in
their practical work.
Material and Methods
An integrative review was conducted to evaluate training intensity studies in elite-level distance running. An integrative review is a broad
research review that allows the researcher to combine theoretical and empirical literature and includes different types of data and different methods (Whittemore and Knafl, 2005). The present
review followed the process described by Whittemore and Knafl (2005), which includes problem identification, literature search, data evaluation, data analysis, and presentation of results.
A literature search was conducted on Feb 20, 2023.
After a review of the following internet databases
(Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science), 26 literature
articles were found analyzing the training intensity distribution (TID) of international distance 
## Page 4
runners. Databases were searched from inception
up to February 2023, with no language limitation. Citations from scientific conferences were
excluded. The title, abstract, and keywords search
fields were searched in each database. The following keywords, combined with Boolean operators
(AND, OR) were used: „Training”, „Running”,
„Long-distance”, „Polarised”, „Pyramidal”, „Intensity”, and „Intensity distribution”. The types
of articles analyzed were review articles, original
research, case studies.
Results
Similarities
In terms of the amount of training per week,
both methods are similar. Elite 1500 and
10,000-meter runners average between 120 and
180 kilometers per week, with 10 to 14 running
sessions weekly (Haugen, Sandbakk, Seiler and
Tonessen, 2022; Casado et al., 2022; Karikosk,
1984; Tjelta, 2016; Tjelta and Enoksen, 2001).
A significant part of the training volume is done
at low intensity (see Figure 1.), both in the pyramidal and polarised models. Runners complete
75-80% of their weekly mileage at low intensity
(Zone 1), below the aerobic threshold (vLT1),
which in their case is roughly the pace of their
estimated marathon race pace (Kenneally et al.,
2017; Enoksen, Tjelta and Tjelta, 2011). The
most commonly used forms of exercise in this
category are 30-70 minute aerobic maintenance
runs and shorter warm-up and cool-down runs,
and morning shake-outs. Most elite runners do
a long run once a week for 90-120 minutes, at
the end of which the intensity can reach Zone
2 (Seiler, 2010; Stöggl, 2015, Esteve-Lanao, San
Juan, Earnest, Foster and Lucia, 2005). The highest intensities, close to race pace, are performed
at short intervals (< 800 m) 1-2 times per week
in both training regimes during the base period, with lactate levels below 8 to 10 mmols/l
(Casado, Hanely, Santos-Concejero and RuizPérez, 2021). These short interval workouts are
done either on hills or on flat terrain (track). The
duration of the intervals is usually 0.5-1 minute and they are often done in sets (for example
2x10x200 meter hills), usually running about 4-8
kilometers of intense distance per session. In the
4-8 weeks before the race season the use of longer,
race-specific intervals with high lactic acid levels
(> 8 mmol/l) is started to mimic the fatigue the
runners will face on the race day (Casado et al.,
2021; Haugen et al., 2022).
## Page 5
Differences:
The biggest difference between the two methods was found in high-intensity aerobic work
(See Table 2). In the pyramid method, runners
performed interval or continuous tempo running
workouts at speeds below the anaerobic threshold
(vLT2) on average 2-4 times per week (Tjelta, Tonessen, and Enoksen, 2014). More recently, the use
of interval training controlled by lactate measurement has become more common (Casado, Foster,
Bakken, and Tjelta, 2023). The specification of
the Norwegian method, which has been very well
published in the literature, is that twice a week,
so-called double-threshold days are performed,
whereby runners run 20 km worth of intervals below the anaerobic threshold during the day (see
Table 2). In the mornings, they mainly run longer
6-10 minutes marathon-paced intervals with short
breaks, while in the afternoon they run shorter,
faster (5km to half-marathon paces) part-distances
between 1000m and 400m. Because of the short
rest periods and the interval format, they can run
faster than the laboratory threshold speed without exceeding a blood lactate level of 4 mmol/l.
(Bakken, 2021; Tjelta, 2013; Tjetla, 2016; Tjelta,
2019). In contrast, in the polarised intensity distribution, interval training was performed on average 1 time per week above the anaerobic threshold
(vLT2) at 90% of vVo2max, which for elite racers
is approximately 10 km or 30-minute race pace.
Typically, 30-40 minutes of intensive work is done
in 3-10 minute intervals (1-3 km distances) with
a rest-to-run ratio of about 1:3 or 1:2. Light jogging or walking is typical during the rest periods.
A common example of this type of training is the
5-6x mile (1609 meters) or 8x1000 meters workout (Keneally, Casado, Gomez-Ezeiza and SantosConcejero, 2022; Ingham, Fudge and Pringle, 2012;
Billat, Lepretre, Heugas, Salim, and Koralsztein,
2003), or the 8x4 minutes with 2-minute rest recommended by Stephen Seiler, up to 4x8 min with
4 min rest at 90% of vVo2max, or 90-93 % mHR
(Filipas, Bonato, Gallo and Godella, 2022; Seiler,
Joranson, Olesen and Hetleid, 2013). These training
sessions can also take a more typical directionalfartlek form at the beginning of the build-up period, where the intense part is given in time and
not distance. Common examples of these fartleksessions are 8-10 x 3 minutes hard (so-called „on”)
with 1.5-2 minutes rest („off”), or pyramidal/
ladder sets like 1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1 minute intense
runs with the same time of easy running in between hard efforts. In addition to the isolated use
of these two methods, there are many examples of
athletes’ training following a pyramidal distribution in the base period and then a polarised pattern as the race period approaches (Kenneally et al.,
2022).
Discussion
The training of modern distance runners is
characterized by a strong emphasis on developing
aerobic capacity, primarily through high volume,
low intensity running and increasingly interval
training 1-4 times per week to develop anaerobic
threshold speed. The Pyramid Method is characterized by 2-4 anaerobic threshold (vLT2) tempo/
interval training sessions per week. The Polarised
Method is characterized by 1 interval training session per week above the anaerobic threshold (90%
vVo2max), with 30-40 minutes of intense work.
Short (< 800 m) intervals close to the race pace
and short sprints are used to maintain anaerobic capacity and race pace coordination during
the build-up. In the pre-competition period (4-8
weeks), longer, intensive, competition-specific interval training sessions begin. During the racing
season, they maintain the endurance gained in the
pre-season, continuing with a significant amount
of low-intensity running and less pronounced but
present anaerobic threshold training. Monitoring
intensity (heart rate, blood lactate, pace charts)
and using appropriate intensity zones (e.g. recovery runs/anaerobic threshold runs) is essential to
perform high-volume work and prevent overload.
During the season, linear periodization is typical
in both cases, with the possibility of single or double form timing (one during the winter indoor season and one during the summer competitive season). In both intensity models, the PI (Polarization
Index) increases during the season, which is due
to the use of more intense training sessions that
simulate near-race fatigue as the race approaches,
increases, and in parallel the importance of endurance training (zone 2) is pushed back. Apart from
using the two intensity models separately, there
are several examples in the literature where the intensity distribution of the competitors has shown
a pyramidal pattern in the baseline period and
then becomes polarised in the pre-race formative 
## Page 6
period for the reasons mentioned above (increase
in PI). In both cases, an alternation of light and
heavy workload days (both in terms of volume
and training intensity) can be observed within the
micro-cycles of the weekly training schedule. Most
runners have 5-10 years of systematic high-volume
training before they reach the international level.
Those runners who have developed their aerobic
skills in their early years, with high volumes of lowintensity runs and frequent high-aerobic training,
will achieve greater success in the long term and
sustain their best years for longer periods (Casado,
Hanley and Luiz-Pérez, 2020; Tjelta, 2010).

Conclusions and Practical Applications
The integrative literature review resulted in
the following key findings: the two internality zone models that best characterize the training of elite distance runners are largely identical. The main differences lie in the number and
use of high-intensity aerobic training sessions.
Whereas in the polarised method, the anaerobic threshold is „pulled up” by a high volume of
high intensity (30-40 minutes of intensive training) once a week at a slightly higher intensity
than the anaerobic threshold (vLT2). In the pyramidal distribution, the same speed is „pushed
up” by more frequent (2-4) intervals or tempo
training below the anaerobic threshold (between
aerobic/ vLT1 and anaerobic/ vLT2 thresholds).
The observations that have been successfully used
in both methods and that can be put into practice
by coaches are summarised below:
• To achieve an international level of distance
running performance, a high level of weekly
training (120-180 km/week) is required.
• Most runners have 5-10 years of systematic
training of high quality and quantity before
achieving an outstanding result.
• A high percentage of the weekly training (70-
80%) should be low intensity, below the aerobic threshold (marathon pace).
• During the base period, focus on developing
speed at the anaerobic threshold (vLT2) with
high-intensity aerobic tempo or interval training 1-4 times per week, using paces between
Marathon and 10 km race speeds, with 20-40
minutes worth of intensive work per session.
• Maintain race speed-related coordination and
anaerobic capacity with short interval running
(>800 m) on flat or uphill terrain, on average
1 time per week, with controlled lactate accumulation (>8 mmol/L) during the base period.
• Development and maintenance of maximal
running speed using short sub-maximal sprint
runs with full rest (> 15 seconds) and using
conditioning and plyometric exercises.
• Use of longer race-specific anaerobic (< 8 mmol/l)
intervals 1-2 times per week in a 4-8 week precompetition period, before racing season.
• Maintain the endurance level acquired during
the race period with high volumes of low-intensity running and level-maintaining anaerobic threshold training.
• To avoid overtraining, close monitoring of
intensity zones and training paces, especially
during low-intensity (Zone 1) and near anaerobic threshold (Zone 2) training, using
heart rate monitoring, pace charts, and lactate
measurement
