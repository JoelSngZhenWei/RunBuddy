NeighbourhoodRegular physical activity offers multifarious benefits to all ages. It impacts the physical health in many ways, 
including reducing the risk of chronic diseases as well as building stronger bones and muscles for functional 
fitness. It also helps improve one’s mental and emotional well-being by reducing stress and anxiety.
Since the national physical activity guidelines for adults and for children and youth were published in 2011 and 
2013 respectively, new evidence has progressively emerged in the last decade and has been adopted by the 
World Health Organisation (WHO) through the publication of the WHO Guidelines on physical activity , sedentary 
behaviour and sleep for children under 5 years of age  in 2019 and the WHO Guidelines on physical activity and 
sedentary behaviour  in 2020.
To support Singaporeans in keeping active in ways that are relevant to them, the Singapore Physical Activity 
Guidelines (SPAG) 2022 adopts the WHO guidelines and sets out recommendations on physical activity and 
reducing sedentary behaviour for different population segments, cutting across life stages – from children 
to adults and older adults. Through these recommendations, we hope to make active lifestyles attainable for 
everyone.
We would like to extend our appreciation to the SPAG advisory committee for developing the guidelines with 
us. These guidelines serve as a national reference for many different stakeholders – medical professionals, 
educators, employers, fitness professionals and community leaders – who play a part in promoting physical 
activity among our population. The guidelines are also meant for the general community; we hope they will 
leverage the recommendations to equip themselves with the knowledge and apply the simple, practical tips to 
embark on a more active lifestyle.
By offering a useful guide to all Singaporeans to live better through sport and physical activity, we will pave the 
way for a more active and healthier nation.

FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE NEED FOR 
UPDATES IN SINGAPORE’S GUIDELINES
SINGAPORE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES AS A 
KEY TOOL FOR PROMOTING PUBLIC HEALTHLifestyle trends and physical activity research has continued to evolve over the years
The WHO has set targets to tackle global physical inactivity 
IMPROVE PUBLIC AWARENESS
Educate the general local community on physical activity guidelines 
and provide practical tips to build towards an active lifestyle.
SUPPORT HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS
Inform and support local health and fitness professionals with 
evidence-based recommendations.CALL TO ACTIONS
Influence policy actions or implementation of programmes that can 
support or promote a culture of active living.
SET STANDARDIZED BENCHMARKS
Standardize benchmarks for monitoring progress of the nation 
towards meeting physical activity recommendations.Previous guidelines were launched in 2011 for adults and in 2013 for children and adolescents
It is timely and strategic to provide new recommendations and best practices to keep up with emerging 
evidence and meet current lifestyle trends 
New set of guidelines is expanded to be inclusive of segments such as pregnant and post-partum women, 
individuals with chronic diseases and individuals with disabilities
There is also an added emphasis on recommendations to break up and reduce sedentary behaviour
Launch of the Global Action Plan on Physical Activity (GAPPA) in 2018, with the vision to have more active 
people and a healthier world by reducing physical inactivity

 AEROBIC ACTIVITY 
PER WEEK
The WHO defines physical activity as any bodily movement 
produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure 
and recommends both moderate- and vigorous-intensity 
physical activity for an improved health.  Sedentary behaviour 
is defined as any waking behaviour while in a sitting, reclining, 
or lying posture with low energy expenditure.  Importantly, 
large amounts of sedentary behaviour are directly associated 
with poorer health outcomes.
Adopting the best practices from the WHO Guidelines on 
Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour, SPAG seeks to 
provide public health recommendations for children, adults, 
and older adults on the amount of physical activity (frequency, 
intensity, and duration) required to achieve significant health 
benefits and mitigate health risks. 
The guidelines are intended for 
policymakers, practitioners, and the public. 
The final recommendations presented 
are for all populations and age groups 
ranging from preschool to 65 years and 
older and are relevant to people of all 
abilities. Those with chronic medical 
conditions and/or disability, pregnant, and 
postpartum women should try to meet the 
recommendations where possible.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

THE BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY     THE BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY   
Physical activity is deﬁned as “any bodily movement produced by the contraction of skeletal muscles that increase 
energy expenditure above a resting level”. Physical activity can broadly be classiﬁed into three intensities – light, moderate and vigorous. When performing physical activity at a light intensity, an individual should be able to talk and sing while moving. At a moderate intensity, talking is comfortable, but singing becomes more diﬃcult. At a vigorous intensity, neither singing or prolonged talking is possible.  
Ability to stay in control of the body when stationary or moving (causes the body to produce a coordinated response, e.g., sensory, strength & ﬂexibility).

SAFER acronym as a way of remembering the key safety tips:
is for screening, sustainability and suitability of exercise and equipment use  
is for awareness of environment (weather), hydration, nutrition, and rest  
is for fitness level, knowing one’s limits (ability and competency)  
is for exercise with buddies to help take care of each other and be aware of emergency protocol and equipment  
is for responsibility of taking ownership of one's safety and learn CPR/AED to support others if needed•

Based on your health/age/medical conditions, do you need to consult a health professional before starting?
• Use pre-participation screening tools such as the Get Active Questionnaire to assess your readiness to take 
part in physical activity.
• If you have been diagnosed with any illness or are unsure what activities you can do, consult a medical/
health professional before you begin.
Are you wearing suitable clothing? Do you have appropriate equipment? Is your equipment safe and in 
working condition?
• Before you start any type of physical activity, ensure that you have the appropriate attire, and equipment  
in working condition.SUITABILITY
When did you last exercise? 
• If you have not exercised in a while, start slow and build up intensity and duration gradually. Listen to your 
body and adapt exercises accordingly.
How are you feeling? Are you appropriately warmed up?
• Listen to your body and adapt exercises accordingly. It is important to incorporate warm-ups and cool-downs 
of at least 5-10 minutes into your routine.FITNESS
Do you know CPR/AED?  
• Take ownership and learn CPR/AED so that you can support those around you in case of an unexpected event. RESPONSIBILITYWhat is the weather like? What time is best to exercise? Are you hydrated / Have ready access to water?
• Avoid adverse weather or heat conditions, e.g. rain or noon hours when the Sun is the hottest. For heat 
management, consider first ensuring you are heat acclimatised, pace accordingly, take more frequent 
breaks, and seek out shelters when it is hot/rainy day. To also dress light and hydrate appropriately.
Is the environment safe?
• Ensure that the space around is free of trip-hazards.AWARENESS
Do you have a buddy to exercise with? 
• Exercising with a friend will allow you to support one another if anything unforeseen happens. 
Are you aware of the emergency protocol and safety equipment close to your exercise location?
• Knowing the emergency protocol and where the closest Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is when 
exercising may help save a life.EXERCISE WITH A BUDDY

�T �S RECOMMENDED THAT‰
Children and Youth should limit the amount of time spent in sedentary behaviours, especially recreational screen time 
as it has been highlighted as the key factor. Instead, they should engage in a variety of physical activities regularly.
Infants below one years old should be encouraged to engage in at least 30 minutes of tummy time per day. Young

At preschool, Danny gets light to moderate physical activity time through class activities such as dancing and organised 
outdoor ball games. At home, Danny is always on the move, particularly after dinner when his playtime includes moderate intensity activities such as chasing, hide-and-seek, and pillow ﬁghts. Sometimes, evening playtime extends beyond his bedtime, and he goes to bed as late as 11.00pm. The early start to the day for school results in diﬃcult mornings as Danny struggles to wake up. 
On weekends, Danny goes swimming with his dad in the morning and his Mum arranges for playground play dates with 
his preschool friends in the afternoon. This allows him to run, jump, and fall in a safe environment which supports the development of his movement skills in an unstructured way. The exposure to water and land-based activities also helps develop his movement competency in a range of environments. DANNYCASE STUDY #2

preschool since she was six months old. Both her parents are oﬃce workers, and her dad usually picks her up from school at 7pm. Due to the busy schedules of her parents, Sophie relies on her schoolteachers to support her daily physical activity needs. This usually includes some dancing, games, and arts and craft tactile work. 
On the weekends, Sophie goes to the playground in the evening with her parents to meet her friends and she engages in 
a combination of running, jumping, and climbing for 60-minutes whilst socialising. Whenever Sophie’s parents must work on weekends, they give Sophie a phone to keep her occupied.

Any level of physical activity is better than none. Where possible, adults should break up prolonged sedentary periods 
with light physical activity for substantial health beneﬁts.  
Adults should accumulate a total equivalent of 150 to 300 minutes of moderate- intensity activity (mostly aerobic) 
throughout the week for substantial health beneﬁts. Spreading the activity throughout the week minimises the risk of injury and prevents excessive fatigue which can contribute towards meeting the recommendations. 
Additionally, adults should engage in moderate- intensity muscle training activities to target the major muscle groups, at 
least twice per week to build their strength. Finding the suitable weight/resistance is key and a general good practice is to complete 8 to 12 repetitions per set to achieve strengthening outcomes. 
For adults with chronic conditions, the same recommendations and tips are still applicable but if unsure on how to begin, 
consult a health professional to determine a suitable exercise regime for you. Meeting the recommendations can oﬀer additional health beneﬁts, such as: 
Diabetes – Resistance training can aid in controlling hormone levels 
Obesity – Physical activity expands energy and by engaging in suﬃcient activity to burn oﬀ excess calories, it can contribute to 
                 weight loss 
Hypertension – Physical activity strengthens your heart and promotes better blood /f_low IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT…Break up sedentary periods of 90+ minutes 
with 5-10 minutes of physical activity. Removed time-speciﬁc recommendations.  
Minimum bouts of 10 minutes of 
moderate-intensity physical activity per week. No minimum duration. 
Single time targets (e.g., 150 MIE minutes).  Clocking in a target range e.g., 150 to 300 
minutes of moderate- intensity activity.

ADULTS (18 - 64 YEARS)
IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT…
Any level of physical activity is better than none. Where possible, adults should break up prolonged sedentary periods 
with light physical activity for health benefits.  
Adults should accumulate a total equivalent of 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity (mostly aerobic) 
throughout the week for health benefits. Spreading the activity throughout the week minimises the risk of injury and 
prevents excessive fatigue which can contribute towards meeting the recommendations. 
Additionally, adults should engage in moderate-intensity muscle strengthening activities targeting the major muscle 
groups at least twice per week to build their strength. Finding the suitable weight/resistance is key and a general good 
practice is to complete 8 to 12 repetitions per set to achieve strengthening outcomes. 
For adults with chronic conditions, the same recommendations and tips are still applicable but if unsure on how to 
begin, consult a health professional to determine a suitable exercise regime.
Meeting the recommendations can offer additional health benefits, such as:
Diabetes – Resistance training can aid in controlling hormone levels 
Obesity – Physical activity expands energy and by engaging in sufficient activity to burn off excess calories, it can contribute to  weight loss 
Hypertension – Physical activity strengthens your heart and promotes better blood flow Previous (2011) What's New
Break up sedentary periods of 90+ minutes 
with 5-10 minutes of physical activity.Removed time-specific recommendations. 
Minimum bouts of 10 minutes of moderate-
intensity physical activity per week.No minimum duration.
Single time targets (e.g. 150 minutes of 
moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week).Clocking in a target range e.g. 150 to 300 
minutes of moderate-intensity activity per 
week.
No minimum intensity for muscle 
strengthening activity.Muscle strengthening activity at moderate- or 
vigorous-intensity is encouraged, at least 2 
days a week.

SINGAPORE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES
FOR ADULTS (18 - 64 YEARS)
Adults are encouraged to engage in physical activity not only through recreation and leisure, 
but also when in diﬀerent settings - At home (household chores), as a form of transportation (cycling, brisk walking, jogging), or in occupational and community settings.
Limit the amount of time spent being 
sedentary, particularly recreational 
screen time, by engaging in activity 
of any intensity .
GET MOVING AND MIX IT UP
Aim for at least 150 to 300 
minutes  of moderate-intensity 
aerobic physical activity per week.
*Every minute of vigorous-intensity activity 
can generally be considered as almost two 
minutes’ worth of moderate-intensity activity.HIT 150 – 300 
Strengthen muscles, bones, and joints through activities  
at moderate- or vigorous-intensity, at least 2 days per week .
For those over 50 years, include multi-component physical 
activity that emphasizes strength and functional balance at 
least 3 days of the week at a moderate or greater intensity.GET STRONGER
For adults with
chronic conditions
(e.g. Type-2 Diabetes 
and Hypertension), the 
recommendations and 
tips are still applicable.
If unsure of how to begin, 
consult a health professional 
to determine a suitable 
exercise regime for you.T�PS
Being active can be enjoyable - 
try a new sport or explore one of the many local parks.Start with small changes like taking the stairs instead of the lift, as better beats perfect.Incorporate active travel into your daily routine, such as heading out to purchase your food and groceries personally and rely less on food deliveries.
Work out your muscle groups through diﬀerent activities such as jogging, swimming, and playing a racquet sport. Start with some light-intensity activity as opposed to being inactive.

SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE: ADULTS
SEDENTARY BEHAVIOUR
High levels of sedentary behaviour, even in healthy 
individuals, are associated with an increasing risk 
of developing cardiovascular disease.High levels of sedentary behaviour, especially 
prolonged periods of sitting screen time, is 
associated with lower quality of sleep, impacting 
mood, cognitive and physical performance.CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE: SLEEP:
Relatively high amounts of sedentary time have 
been associated with significantly greater risk for 
Type-2 Diabetes.Evidence suggests that higher levels of 
sedentary behaviour results in increased 
frequency and severity of anxiety and 
depressive symptoms.MENTAL HEALTH: TYPE-2 DIABETES:
AEROBIC ACTIVITY
Aerobic activity reduces blood pressure in pre-
hypertension adults, and reduces incident 
hypertension, both key risk indicators of 
cardiovascular diseases.Higher levels of physical activity are associated with 
a reduced risk (10-20%) of multiple cancers such as 
colon, breast, bladder, liver, renal and more.BLOOD PRESSURE & HYPERTENSION:
Inverse curvilinear relationship between physical 
activity and incidence of Type-2 Diabetes, with 
no significant difference by ethnicity and weight 
status.Higher levels of aerobic activity was associated 
with a 17% lower incidence of anxiety and 24% 
lower incidence of depression among adults.TYPE-2 DIABETES: MENTAL HEALTH:CANCER:
VIGOROUS-INTENSITY AND MUSCLE/BONE STRENGTHENING ACTIVITIES
Resistance training increases lean muscle mass 
and resting metabolic rate, aiding fat loss in adults, 
and reducing the rate of muscle loss.Resistance training increases bone mineral density 
in adults, which helps to reduce incidence of lower 
back pain and mitigate symptoms of arthritis.BODY COMPOSITION:
Muscle-strengthening activity is associated 
with improvements in cognition (memory and 
processing speed) and lowered the risk of 
Alzheimer’s disease.Resistance training and yoga are correlated 
with improvements in sleep quality and mental 
health indicators, such as reducing symptoms 
of anxiety and depression.COGNITIVE FUNCTION: MENTAL HEALTH:BONE HEALTH:

As a parent with young kids, Amanda usually prioritises her family’s needs before her own, such as ferrying her children 
around and completing household chores. With her busy work schedule, she had little time for exercise. However, Amanda learnt about High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) workouts which can help her achieve more in less time. She started doing HIIT during her free time and eventually incorporated a quick 20-min HIIT workout into her day. With HIIT, Amanda also included weights training and overtime, she noticed that her usual chores were not as tiring as she feels physically stronger. Even on hectic days, Amanda still does a 20-min workout every other day because it has become something she enjoys, and it helps her feel more ready for the day. On weekends, Amanda also tries to do more group activities with her family, such as exploring local nature trails or cycling through the wide network of park connectors. 
It’s great to hear that Amanda has found an enjoyable way to meet the recommended level of physical activity despite her 
busy schedule. For working moms who would like to do the same, try the following:

Nicholas’s job as a delivery man is physically demanding. He delivers parcels from the warehouse to different 
locations, requiring him to lift items of various sizes and weights and walking short distances to deliver the items (i.e., 
from the van to the apartment). He usually takes the lift to higher floors but sometimes chooses to take the stairs for 
deliveries to lower floors to save time.  
As his work hours are irregular (working on both weekdays and weekends), he does not have a fixed exercise routine 
and uses random pockets of time to go fishing with his friends. On his day off, he meets up with his friends at the 
coffeeshop for meals and drinks, where he can enjoy some downtime and relieve stress from work. Apart from this, he 
spends most of his off days resting at home.
Nisha is a hotel manager who is recently retired. She mindfully slows down her pace of life by revisiting old hobbies. 
She conducts part-time cooking classes at the nearby Community Centre and volunteers with a sports interest group 
as a local guide, occasionally organising community health and wellbeing events.
Unfortunately, Nisha was subsequently diagnosed with Type-2 Diabetes. She manages her condition by making 
gradual lifestyle changes like using healthier alternatives when cooking. She also keeps herself active by participating 
in a variety of community fitness classes such as zumba and yoga at least twice a week, and hikes with her interest 
group once a month. Nisha has always been motivated to learn more about taking ownership of her health, but her 
recent annual health check-up gave her a surprise. She learnt that she has low skeletal muscle mass and is at risk of 
sarcopenia. Worried and puzzled, Nisha hopes to understand why she is at-risk despite being active and how she can 
combat age-related muscle loss. Climbing stairs while making deliveries is a good practice to get an aerobic workout. Being a delivery man, he is 
already getting work-related physical activity in his daily routine. He may benefit from some strength, mobility, and 
flexibility exercises to enhance his quality of movement and build strength.  If you’re like Nicholas and have irregular 
working hours, here are some tips for individuals to achieve a healthier lifestyle. 
Try playing a sport with your friends before 
going for a meal together. By doing so, you get 
to spend quality time plus keep fit and relieve 
stress. 
Incorporate muscle-strengthening exercises at 
least 2 days a week to combat age-related muscle 
loss. Incorporate mobility and flexibility 
movements throughout the day to increase 
your systemic blood circulation and help the 
overworked joints and muscles feel better.
If you are exercising close to bedtime, 
try keeping to a light- or moderate-
intensity exercise to avoid disruptions to 
your sleep.

tips that could benefit Nisha and others in a similar situation:
Participate in dance classes, such as zumba, at higher 
frequencies and alternate between dance activities 
and strengthening exercises, such as Active Health 
workshops aimed to combat age-related loss of muscles.You can protect yourself from

Ever since her ﬁrst pregnancy, Jaime has been leading a more sedentary lifestyle as she juggles the demands of work and 
taking care of her child. Recently, Jaime learnt that she is expecting her second child and her doctor advised that it is important to start adopting an active lifestyle for herself and her new child. Jaime was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) during her ﬁrst pregnancy and coupled with her now inactive lifestyle, she has an increased risk of GDM recurring. 
Jaime goes for an occasional 30-min stroll only when she ﬁnds the free time between a full day of work and caring for her 
child. With her doctor’s advice, she tries to gradually squeeze in a 15-min workout during lunch time and attend a weekly prenatal yoga class on the weekends. She hopes to gradually build up her activity by consulting her doctor regularly to keep herself and her new child healthy.Sedentary mom with an increased risk of GDMJAIME, 32CASE STUDY #2
Jaime’s attempt to build up her activity level is commendable. For other mums who are trying to do the 
same, here are some simple ways to build up your activity levels:
Work closely with your doctor to come up with an exercise regimen that includes aerobic activities and muscle strengthening exercises.
Incorporate resistance training as it is beneﬁcial in strengthening your muscles and aiding in glucose control.Try swimming for a low-impact full body workout.
Plan for pool days or going for long strolls at the park with your family as a workout and spend quality time together.Isla has adopted a great mindset of maintaining an active lifestyle throughout pregnancy. For expectant mums like Isla, it is important to note the following:Isla is 18 weeks pregnant. Before she got pregnant, Isla enjoyed an active lifestyle where she engaged in a variety of 
workouts during her leisure time, ranging from boxing to spin classes. She is motivated to continue being physically active, so she keeps her doctor informed of her activities throughout her pregnancy. She used to go for long hikes on the weekends and continued to do so in her 1st trimester. As her pregnancy progressed, she slowly adapted to her body’s condition and replaced hikes with daily 30-min walks in the park. Isla also changed her weekly workouts to resistance band exercises to strengthen her muscles. Each weekend, Isla will attend a prenatal yoga session for extra strength training and to learn some simple exercises that she can safely do at home. Isla is looking forward to resuming her physical activity and trying out postnatal yoga after her delivery, once her doctor deems it is safe for her to do so.

and taking care of her child. Recently, Jaime learnt that she is expecting her second child and her doctor advised that 
it is important to start adopting an active lifestyle for herself and her child. Jaime was diagnosed with Gestational 
Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) during her first pregnancy and coupled with her current inactive lifestyle, she has an 
increased risk of it recurring. 
Jaime goes for a 30-minute stroll only when she finds the free time between a full day of work and caring for her child. 
With her doctor’s advice, she tries to gradually squeeze in a 15-minute workout during lunch time and attends a weekly 
prenatal yoga class on the weekends. She hopes to gradually build up her activity by consulting her doctor regularly to 
keep herself and her child healthy.
Jaime's attempt is commendable. For other mothers who are trying to do the same, here are some simple ways to 
build up your activity levels:
Work closely with 
your doctor to come 
up with an exercise 
regimen that includes 
aerobic activities and 
muscle-strengthening 
exercises.Try swimming for a low-impact 
full body workout.Incorporate activities like 
Pilates, yoga, and resistance 
band exercises to maintain 
muscle mass and aid in 
glucose control. Plan for pool days or going for 
long strolls at the park with your 
family as a workout and spend 
quality time together.CASE STUDY #1

Term Definition
AdiposityA condition of being morbidly overweight or obese. Excessive fat 
accumulation in the body, as measured by BMI, BMI-for-age, BMI 
z-score, skinfold thickness, body fat mass.
Body mass index (BMI) Weight (kg) / height (m)2Aerobic physical activityActivity in which the body’s large muscles move in a rhythmic manner 
for a sustained period. Aerobic activity – also called endurance activity – 
improves cardiorespiratory fitness. Examples include walking, running, 
swimming, and bicycling.
Body compositionThe proportion of fat and fat-free mass in the body. This can be 
measured as percentage body fat.
Body mass index (see below) and waist circumference are proxies for 
body composition and in most situations, are good indicators of health 
risk associated with excess adiposity.
Bone-strengthening 
activityPhysical activity primarily designed to increase the strength of specific 
sites in bones that make up the skeletal system. Bone-strengthening 
activities produce an impact or tension force on the bones that 
promotes bone growth and strength.
Running, jumping rope, and lifting weights are examples of bone-
strengthening activities.Balance trainingStatic and dynamic exercises that are designed to improve an individual’s 
ability to withstand challenges from postural sway or destabilizing 
stimuli caused by self-motion, the environment, or other objects.
Cardiorespiratory fitness 
(endurance)A health-related component of physical fitness. The ability of the 
circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen during sustained 
physical activity. Usually expressed as measured or estimated maximal 
oxygen uptake (VO2 max).
Cardiovascular disease 
(CVD)Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart 
and blood vessels. They include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular 
disease, peripheral arterial disease, deep vein thrombosis and 
pulmonary embolism among others.
Cognitive functionCerebral activities, i.e. reasoning, memory, attention, and language that 
lead to the attainment of information and knowledge. This can also 
include learning.Cardiometabolic healthThe interplay of blood pressure, blood lipids, blood glucose and insulin 
on health.GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Term Definition
DisabilityFrom the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and 
Health (WHO), an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations, 
and participation restrictions, denoting the negative aspects of the 
interaction between an individual (with a health condition) and that 
individual’s contextual factors (environmental and personal factors).
FlexibilityA health- and performance-related component of physical fitness that is 
the range of motion possible at a joint. Flexibility is specific to each joint 
and depends on a number of specific variables including, but not limited 
to, the tightness of specific ligaments and tendons. Flexibility exercises 
enhance the ability of a joint to move through its full range of motion.ExerciseA subcategory of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, 
and purposeful in the sense that the improvement or maintenance of 
one or more components of physical fitness is the objective. “Exercise” 
and “exercise training” frequently are used interchangeably and 
generally refer to physical activity performed during leisure time with 
the primary purpose of improving or maintaining physical fitness, 
physical performance, or health.
FitnessA measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and effectively in 
work and leisure activities, and includes, for example, physical fitness 
and cardiorespiratory fitness.
FrailtyFrailer older adults are those who are identified as being frail or have 
very low physical or cognitive function, perhaps because of chronic 
disease such as arthritis, dementia, or advanced old age itself. Executive functionIncludes constructs such as: working memory, cognitive flexibility 
(also called flexible thinking) and inhibitory control (which includes 
self-control)
Interactive activities / playActivities with a parent or caregiver that do not involve screens as a 
mode of entertainment. These can include reading, singing, storytelling, 
colouring, block building, cutting out, puzzles and games.
See “Play”.
Interactive play is play with a parent or caregiver where the child and 
adult/older child interact and engage in play for both cognitive and 
motor learning.

physical activityLight-intensity physical activities between 1.5 and 3 METS, i.e. activities with 
energy cost less than 3 times the energy expenditure at rest for that person.
This can include slow walking, bathing, or other incidental activities that do 
not result in a substantial increase in heart rate or breathing rate.Functional trainingExercises that can be embedded into everyday tasks to improve lower-
body strength, balance, and motor performance. Examples include 
tandem and one-leg stands, squatting, chair stands, toe raises, and 
stepping over obstacles.GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Term Definition
Major muscle groupsMajor muscle groups include the legs, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders 
and arms.
Muscle-strengthening 
activityPhysical activity and exercise that increase skeletal muscle strength, 
power, endurance, and mass (e.g. strength training, resistance training, 
or muscular strength and endurance exercises).Metabolic equivalent of 
task (MET)The metabolic equivalent of task, or simply metabolic equivalent, is 
a physiological measure expressing the energy cost (or calories) of 
physical activities. One MET is the energy equivalent expended by an 
individual while seated at rest.
Motor Development - 
Fundamental Movement 
Skills (FMS)Development of a child’s musculoskeletal system and acquisition of 
gross motor skills (sometimes referred to as fundamental movement 
skills FMS), and fine motor skills, including object control.Moderate-intensity 
physical activityOn an absolute scale, moderate-intensity refers to the physical 
activity that is performed between 3 and less than 6 times the 
intensity of rest. On a scale relative to an individual’s personal 
capacity, moderate-intensity physical activity is usually 5 or 6 on a 
scale of 0-10.
Non-Communicable 
Diseases (NCDs)A disease that is not transmissible directly from one person to another
Physical activityAny bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires 
energy expenditure.
Physical inactivityAn insufficient physical activity level to meet present physical 
activity recommendations.Multi-component 
physical activityMulti-component physical activity is important to improve physical 
function and decrease the risk of falls or injury from a fall. These 
activities can be done at home or in a structured group setting. Many 
studied interventions combine all types of exercise (aerobic, muscle 
strengthening, and balance training) into a session, and this has been 
shown to be effective. An example of a multi-component physical activity 
programme could include walking) aerobic activity), lifting weights 
(muscle strengthening), and incorporates balance training. Examples 
of balance training can include walking backwards or sideways or 
standing on one foot while doing an upper body muscle-strengthening 
activity, such as bicep curls. Dancing also combines aerobic and balance 
components.GLOSSARY OF TERMS
47 

Term Definition
PlayPlay is defined as being for its own sake (without a specific goal), 
voluntary, enjoyed by participants and imaginative. It can be solitary 
or social, and with or without objects. Young children acquire and 
consolidate developmental skills through playful interactions with 
people and objects.
Recreational screen timeTime spent watching screens (television (TV), computer, mobile devices) 
for purposes other than those related to education/study or work.Psychosocial health Include mental, emotional, and social dimensions of health.
Sedentary behaviourAny waking behaviour characterized by an energy expenditure of 
1.5 METS or lower while sitting, reclining, or lying. Most desk-based 
office work, driving a car, and watching television are examples of 
sedentary behaviours; these can also apply to those unable to stand, 
such as wheelchair users. The guidelines operationalize the definition 
of sedentary behaviour to include self-reported low movement sitting 
(leisure time, occupational, and total), television (TV viewing or screen 
time, and low levels of movement measured by devices that assess 
movement or posture).PostpartumPostpartum refers to a period after the end of pregnancy. The 
postpartum period is commonly defined as up to six weeks 
following the end of pregnancy, with the late postpartum period 
from six weeks up to one year after the end of pregnancy. For 
these Guidelines postpartum includes up to one year post delivery. 
SportSport covers a range of activities performed within a set of rules and 
undertaken as part of leisure or competition. Sporting activities involve 
physical activity carried out by teams or individuals and may be supported 
by an institutional framework, such as a sporting agency.
Vigorous-intensity 
physical activityOn an absolute scale, vigorous-intensity refers to physical activity 
that is performed at 6.0 or more METS. On a scale relative to an 
individual’s personal capacity, vigorous-intensity physical activity is 
usually 7 or 8 on a scale of 0-10. Every minute of vigorous-intensity 
activity can generally be considered as two minutes worth of 
moderate-intensity activity.
Tummy timeTime an infant spends lying on their front (in prone position) while 
awake with unrestricted movement of limbs.

A A diagnosis  of/treatment  for 
heart  disease  or stroke,  or pain/  
discomfort/pressure  in your 
chest  during  activities  of daily  
living  or during  physical  activity?
□ YESPhysical  activity  is likely to be beneficial.  If you have been treated  for heart  
disease  but have not connpleted  a cardiac  rehabilitation  program  within  the 
past 6 months,  consult  a doctor  - a supervised  cardiac  rehabilitation  program  
is strongly  recommended.  If you are resuming  physical  activity  after more  than
6 months  of inactivity,  begin  slowly  with light-  to moderate-intensity  physical 
activity.  If you have pain/discomfort/pressure  in your chest  and it is new for you, 
talk to a doctor.  Describe  the symptom  and what activities  bring it on.
B A diagnosis  of/treatment  
for high blood  pressure  
 BP), or a resting  BP of
1,60/90  mmHg  or higher?
□ YESPhysical  activity  is likely  to be beneficial  if you have been diagnosed  and treated  for 
high blood  pressure   BP). If you are unsure  of your resting  BP, consult a health  care 
provider  or a Qualified  Exercise  Professional   QEP)  to have it measured.  If you are 
taking  BP medication  and your BP is under  good  control,  regular  physical  activity  
is recommended  as it may help to lower  your BP. Your doctor  should  be aware  of 
your physical  activity  level so your medication  needs  can be monitored.  If your BP 
is 160/90  or higher,  you should  receive  medical  clearance  and consult a QEP about  
safe and appropriate  physical  activity.
C Dizziness  or lightheadedness  
during  physical  activity
□ yesThere  are several  possible  reasons  for feeling  this way and many  are not 
worrisome.  Before  becoming  more  active,  consult  a health  care provider  to 
identify  reasons  and minimize  risk. Until then, refrain  from increasing  the intensity  
of your physical  activity.
D Shortness  of breath  at rest
□ YiSIf you have asthma  and this is relieved with medication,  light to moderate  
physical  activity  is safe. If your shortness  of breath  is not relieved  with medication,  
consult  a doctor,
E Loss of consciousness/  
fainting  for any reason
□ YiSBefore  becoming  more active,  consult  a doctor  to identify  reasons  and 
minimize  risk. Once  you are medically  cleared,  consult  a Qualified  Exercise  
Professional   QEP)  about  types  of physical  activity  suitable  for your condition.
F Concussion
□ yesA concussion  is an injury  to the brain  that requires  time to recover.  Increasing  
physical  activity  while  still experiencing  symptoms  may worsen  your symptoms,  
lengthen  your recovery,  and increase  your risk for another  concussion.  A health 
care provider  will let you know  when  you can start becoming  more  physically 
active,  and a Qualified  Exercise  Professional   QEP)  can help get you started.

Do you currently  have pain or swelling  in any part of your  body  (such as 
from an injury,  acute  flare-up  of arthritis,  or back  pain  that affects  your  
ability  to be physically  active?□ YiS
If this swelling  or pain is new, consult  a health  care provider.  Otherwise,  keep  joints  healthy  and reduce  pain by moving  
your  joints  slowly  and gently  through  the entire  pain-free  range  of motion.  If you have hip, knee or ankle  pain, choose 
low-impact  activities  such as swimming  or cycling.  As the pain subsides,  gradually  resume  your normal  physical  activities  
starting  at a level lower  than before  the flare-up,  Consult  a Qualified  Exercise  Professional   QEP)  in follow-up  to help you 
become  more  active  and prevent  or minimize  future  pain.
