## Page 1
Singapore is the world’s only city-state, having gained independence from Britain in 1963. With a population of 6 million, the country is a global commerce, finance and transport hub. It is small, about 2/3 the size of New York City, measuring 50 km from east to west and 27 km from north to south, with nearly 200 km of coastline. Despite its density and many high-rises, there’s wonderful running in Singapore, due to an active greening policy, which has covered the island with tropical plants, parks, and trails. Singapore is one of our favorite cities to run in Asia.

Some of the best places to run in Singapore are downtown in the marina area, with waterfront paths and the iconic Gardens by the Bay. Other waterfront runs include the East and West coast linear parks, the Singapore River, and Macritchie Reservoir. Favorite parks & gardens for running include Fort Canning, the Botanic Gardens, Judong Gardens, & Pasir Ris Park. Trail runners will love Clementi Forest, the Southern Ridges Route, Bukit Timah, and Pulau Ubin Island. There’s also excellent waterfront & park running near the Airport. It’s also worth a quick trip across the Straits of Johor for some excellent running in Johor Bahru at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. 

Runner Notes: Singapore’s weather is consistently hot & humid, so use caution! Many of Singapore’s running spots are well lit at night, which is helpful as there are not late sunsets due to Singapore’s location close to the equator. Singapore’s public transportation system, the MRT, is excellent: a combination of trains, subways, and light rail.

## Marina Bay Sights and Architecture
This is a fantastic run mainly along the water, taking in some of  Singapore’s major arts and cultural sites and unique architecture. We have designed two runs along Marina Bay, nearly all of it on dedicated paths. The short run is 3.4 miles, which does a loop around the main Marina Bay.  One can start anywhere, but a central point is the Coleman Bridge. Head east along the Singapore River. Sites along the route, in order along the run, include: the elegant Fullerton Hotel; Arts House Performing Arts Center;Victoria Theater; Parliament House; Asian Civilization Museum; the futuristic Esplanade – Theaters Along the Bay; The Float, the world’s largest floating stadium and Stage; the Helix Bridge, modeled on DNA structure; the flower-shaped Arts Science Museum; several spectacular waterfront restaurants along the western side of the museum; and Merlion, the iconic conic, 8.5m-tall statue with the body of a fish & head of a lion, shooting water from its mouth.

The “long run” is 9.5 miles, adding the larger section along the Bay, heading past the Singapore Flyer observation wheel, along the water’s banks. On the eastern side of the marina, paths take you by Singapore’s sports complex including the National Stadium, Aquatic Center, the Singapore Sports Hub, the Singapore Indoor Stadium, and the Kallang Theater. The final section of the run passes along the Marina Bay Golf Course, taking a pedestrian bridge by the Marina Barrage ( a dam in Singapore built at the confluence of five rivers), and skirts the Gardens by the Bay. Add-on options include East Coast park, accessible from the paths along the eastern part of the marina, and the paths in the Gardens by the Bay.

## Waterfront Run – Downtown Core to Stadium

This is another version of some waterfront running in Singapore. It’s easily accessible from hotels and offices in the central business district. Make your way down toward the Helix bridge, and follow the waterfront promenade toward Kallang. There are water views most of the way, and pleasant footpaths and foliage. The path ends near the Merdeka Bridge.  On the return, there are great views of the skyline. This is a good run to do at night.

Our route is a there and back. Add some mileage by looping around Marina Bay (near the Sands hotel).

## Singapore River

There is pleasant running along the Singapore River. It’s possible to go about 3.8 miles one-way from the Parliament area in the downtown core, heading west toward the Queenstown Stadium. Of course, you can shorten the run by starting near where you are staying, or turning around at some point. There are pedestrian ways along both sides of the river, in most sections. Then better initial section is on the northern side, then cross the pedestrian bridge to head to the southern side at the 1.7 mile mark. The path turns into the Alexandra Canal Linear Park, which is a very pleasant path. Bonus: Well lit at night.

## Gardens by the Bay and Fort Canning Park
One of our favorite runs in Singapore is to combine Gardens by the Bay with nearby Fort Canning Park, using paths along the Singapore River and Marina Bay to connect them.

Start with the ~2 km loop of Fort Canning Park — an iconic hilltop landmark once sited the palaces of 14th century Malay Kings and served as the Headquarters of the Far East Command Centre and British Army Barracks. This is one of the few places in Singapore to do some hills. There are expansive lawns and lush gardens, great for running, some good hills, stairs, and additional side paths. Fort Canning Park is located right at city center and reachable from most of the hotels.

Then, connect to Gardens By the Bay. It’s 2km on paths along the Singapore River, using the Esplanade & Helix pedestrian bridges.  The Gardens is a top visited site in Singapore. Opened in 2012, it’s a spectacular 250-acre nature park, consisting of three waterfront gardens: Bay South Garden, Bay East Garden and Bay Central Garden. There are also numerous indoor gardens and conservatories (Flower Dome, Cloud Forest), for which ticketed admission is required. The best running — and where biking is also permitted — is the ~2.7 km along the waterfront promenade in Bay South and the perimeter of Bay East Interim Garden. One can add with the interior walkways of the outdoor trails, but they can be crowded at certain times and running might be discouraged.

Add-On: Marina Bay loop.



## East Coast Park

East Coast Park is one of the most popular places for running and biking in Singapore. A paved, flat multi-use path runs from the Marina Bay area near downtown, heading east toward the airport, paralleling the East Coast Parkway, for up to 11.7 km. The east end is at Tanah Merah Beach. There are water views and lush greenery the entire way. Sections pass along a public beach. This is not a remote park. It can crowded. There are numerous recreational activities in the park, plus restrooms, water, and other facilities. Bonus: Much of the path is lit at night. 

Sights along the way include Bedok Jetty/Amber Bacon Tower (2 km), Singapore Wake Park, and the National Service Golf Club at the east end. For a short add-on, take a jaunt out Bedok Jetty (2 km mark). East Coast Park is also home to Parkrun, a free group 5k held every Saturday morning.

Add-On: At the west end, see our Marina East/Gardens By the Bay route.

## Near Airport: Jurassic Mile, Changi Beach Park, Pasir Ris Park

Singapore boasts some of the best running options near an airport of any city we know. There are several options here. Our thanks to Joylin Nodwell for some of these route suggestions.  Bonus: All these paths are lit.

Jurassic Mile: Up to 4 km one-way. If you have a layover, this is the run for you! This relatively new route is a red coloured path that passes by 20 life-sized outdoor dinosaurs over 1 km. The path continues along the coast, with only one road crossing, to connect to the East Coast Park path. Total is 4 km from the airport to East Coast Park.


Changi Beach Park. Up to 7 km one-way. This is a pleasant off-road run mainly along the coast to Changi Beach. From Aviation Park Road, run on the paved path for 2 km to Changi Bay Point. There are lovely water views. Continue on the paved palm-lined path paralleling Changi Coast Rd., to Changi Beach and Changi Beach Park on the Changi Coast Track. It’s up to 7 km one-way.


Pasir Ris Park and Tampines. Northeast of Changi Airport, there are several parks with pleasant jogging paths in the Pasir Ris and Tampines planning/residential areas. There are many paths, so it’s hard to designate a specific route. One can easily do a 15k run here!

Pasir Ris Park. This park is 3.5 km from east to west, passing through four ‘areas’. Palm-lined, with nice landscaping and water views. Area 1 is the Costa Lawn, Area 2 features a maze park & bird watching tower, and Area 3 follows Pasir Ris Beach.
South to Pasir Ris Town Park & Tampines. Up to 4.5 km one-way. This is another series of paths that can be combined with the above. From Area 1 of Pasir Ris Park, follow the paths south along the canal for 1 km to Pasir Ris Town Park, which features additional trails and a fishing park . Continue south for 1 km to Tampines Eco Green, a nice open space with grassy paths. Continue south into Sun Plaza Park.


## Punggol Area Waterfront, Parks, & Serangoon Island
In the Punggol area in the northeastern part of Singapore, there’s some very scenic running on waterfront paths, around Serangoon (Coney) Island, and Waterway Park. Given the extensive number of paths and trails, there are a few options here.

Lor Halus & Serangoon Island Loop. This is a great 8 km loop. Start just across the Lor Halus Red Bridge and run along the waterfront path, enjoying views of the wetlands and the Serangoon East Dam. Cross onto Serangoon Island, also called Coney Island Park. Run for 3 km through this park, which features wide gravel paths through lush greenery (but no water views) at the southern end, and a scenic waterfront section at the northern end. Exit the West Entrance and then head back south on the paved Punggol Promenade Nature Walk path, enjoying views of the channel.

Punggol Promenade & Waterway Park. This is an add-on or alternative. From the Coney Island West Entrance, head north toward Punggol Point, and then run for 1.7 km west along the Northshore on the paved Punggol Promenade Point Walk. Connect to Punggol Waterway Park — a pleasant green space along a waterway, with walking & cycle paths. Head south through the park for 3.3 km to the Lor Halus Bridge. Overall, it’s 6.8 km from Coney West Entrance.

## Macritchie Reservoir
Macritchie Reservoir is a wonderful nature trail getaway only 10km from the downtown core. This 6.5 loop around a nature trail offers great variety: a path by a golf course, trails edging along a man-made reservoir, a treetop walk along a suspension bridge, and paths through lush vegetation. There are other recreational opportunities in the park, especially on the reservoir and in the park on the southern end. Keep an eye out for the macaques!


## Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park & Kallang River Path
Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, a 62-hectare city park along the banks of a former canal, is a nice place for a run in the heartland of the Bishan and Ang Mo Kio residential district in central Singapore. A series of paved trails wind through gardens and lawns. A loop of the park is ~6.4 km. Note that Marymount Rd. bisects the two sections of the park — be sure to use the connector trail at the south end. There’s a running track adjacent to Marymount Rd. Also site of a weekly parkrun, Saturdays 7:30 am. 

Longer Option: A paved multi-use path follows the Kallang River (more of a narrow canal) south of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park for nearly 4 km to the Pan Island Expressway (PIE). 

## West Coast Park
This is the signature run in the west coast section of Singapore. A lovely 5k loop that provides great views of the water. It is just south of the National University of Singapore, and parallels the West Coast Highway. There are myriad facilities in the park, including shelters, restrooms, a playground, and a wildlife marsh, connected by a boardwalk. There is a tunnel connecting the two sections of the park.

West Coast Park is also home to Parkrun, a free group 5k held every Saturday morning. You can see the course map and learn more here.

## Bedok Reservoir Loop
There’s a nice gravel path around the Bedok Reservoir, a former sand quarry in the eastern section of Singapore, toward the airport.  It’s one of the more popular recreation areas in Singapore. The loop around the reservoir is 4.3 km (2.6 miles), with water views for most of the route. There are water fountains and bathrooms. The path is fairly open, so be cautious about the sun and heat.

Add-Ons: For a longer run, extend from the southern part of the reservoir into Bedok Park, a linear green space that extends for up to 3.4 km. There are separate cycle and pedestrian paths.

## Southern Ridges Area: Kent Ridge Park, Hort Park, Telok Blangah Hill Park, Mount Faber Park
This is a unique and verdant run through a lush landscape, featuring two lengthy ‘tree walks’ — springy bridges above the canopy — plus the impressive Henderson Wave and Alexandra Arch pedestrian bridges. The ‘Southern Ridges’ area comprises four connected green spaces forming sort of a linear park: Kent Ridge Park, Hort Park, Telok Blangah Hill Park, and Mount Faber Park. There are paved multi-use paths connecting these parks, plus an option to take more rugged, gravel paths as well.  Our thanks to Tanya J. for her contributions to this route!

The full route is up to 7.5 km one-way, including the ~1 km from the Kent MRT Station to Kent Ridge Park. The hilly route is rewarded with splendid views of the canopy and the city. There are water bubblers at Kent Ridge Park and before Henderson Waves Bridge.

One alternative option for a start is at Alexandra Canal, where you can run on a decent sidewalk along Henderson Rd./Mount Faber Rd. for 2 km south into Mount Faber Park.

## Pandan River Trail
The trail along the Pandan River is an flat, straight ~5 km shot. Paved, with river views most of the way. The trail is also known as the Ulu Pandan Park Connector. It runs from the Buona Vista MRT stop in the east to just past Clementi Ave. 3 km  to the east is Singapore Botanical Gardens (not connected by a path).

Add-Ons: Just to the east on Commonwealth Ave., connect to the Rail Corridor trail, which is a paved multi-use path that runs for 16.5 km. It’s 6 km north to Bukit Timah Nature Preserve. Along the way, pop into the Clementi Forest for some nice trail running.

## Bukit Timah Nature Reserve
Bukit Timah Nature Reserve offers an opportunity for some hilly trail running a mere 12 km from the city. The 163-hectare preserve is primary rain forest, with a wonderful variety of fauna & flora, and lush vegetation. There’s a good variety of trails for running. The reserve features a dairy farm, nature park, quarries, and Singapore’s largest hill at 163m. NOTE: walking/running is not permitted the designated trails for mountain biking.

This trail map has good information on the trail distances, features, and level of difficulty. The easiest trail for running is the 4.5 km Wallace Trail. The 11 km Scenic Quarries Trail is a more challenging option. For some hills, take the trail to the 163m summit of Bukit Timah Hill, which also features the ‘Summit Steps’.

Add-On: The Rail Corridor Trail passes through the western edge of the Preserve. Can add on by running south along the Rail Corridor Trail, which connects to the Clementi Forest & Pandan River Trail.

## Jurong Lake Gardens
Jurong Lake Gardens is a wonderful new addition to the Singapore running scene. Opened in stages but completed in late 2024, the 90-acre green oasis in the Jurong Lake District consists of four themed gardens: Lakeside Garden, Chinese and Japanese Gardens, and Garden Promenade. These lush spaces are interconnected by a series of roads and trails. Running is permitted in Jurong Lake Gardens, though there are a few sections where it isn’t encouraged and runners should be respectful of other users — it can get crowded. Note: Open all day and night, and much of the gardens are lit. There are restrooms and food facilities.

For running, there are a couple of options: the 3.3 km Banyan Trail & the 1.75 km Mempat Trail tour Lakeside Garden, on  a combination of paved & gravel surfaces. Run them separately or combine. Add with a ~3 km loop out to Chinese and Japanese Gardens. We’ve also mapped a full tour of Jurong Lake Gardens, which can be nearly 13 km! 

Add-Ons: The Jurong Lake District is an emerging commercial district in Singapore. The long-term plan is for 100 hectares of green spaces, 70 hectares of water bodies and 17 km of waterfront areas — so keep an eye out for new trails for running! 

## Rail Corridor Trail & Clementi Forest
This is another decent running option in the Bukit Timah area. The Rail Corridor is a mostly paved multi-use path thayt runs for 16.5 km from just north of the Bukit Timah Nature Preserve, south to the Singapore Art Museum at Tanjong Pagar Distripark. Choose a section for a run, or use it as a connector to other routes, such as the Bukit Timah Preserve, and the Pandan River Trail (9 km mark). Much of the trail runs along a busy corridor. A nicer section is the ~6 km between Bukit Timah Rd. and the Queensway Rd. in Queenstown. This part of the trail also passes the Clementi Forest (below).

Clementi Forest. Just off the Rail Corridor Trail at the 6 km mark on our mapped route. Some nice trail running through one of Singapore’s last remaining patches of primary rain forest. Two new trails are about to open in 2023.

Add-Ons: Bukit Timah Preserve (northern part of Rail Corridor path passes through it). Pandan River Trail (9 km mark of Rail Corridor).


## Woodlands Area: Waterfront & Parks Loop
Woodlands is a planned community in the northern part of Singapore. We’ve created a nice 10k loop combining the waterfront and some lovely, green parks. It’s easy to shorten this route.

Start at Woodlands Waterfront Park. This scenic park overlooking the Johor Straits features scenic waterfront paths with great views of the water and Johor Bahru across the way. A loop of the park is ~2 km, going out along the waterfront path one-way (including a jaunt out the jetty) and the lush, interior park paths the other. Continue west along the waterfront Admiralty Rd. toward the causeway for another 1 km, then head south on a connector path to Marsiling Park, which has paved, green paths along a couple of small lakes. Exit the east end of the park onto Woodlands Center Rd. and take the cycle/pedestrian path along Marsiling Rd. for 1.4 km east to Admiralty Park. It’s 2 km north through Admiralty Park — a lovely spot with paved & gravel trails, a boardwalk, mangrove swamp, & fitness stations.

Shorter Options: Can just do the waterfront route, for a 6 km out and back. Can also eliminate one of the parks.

Add-Ons: Just south of Marsiling Rd., there’s the hilltop Woodlands Town Park — good opportunity to get in some hill work! — and a running track at Woodlands Stadium.

## Destination Run: Pulau Ubin Island
For a scenic destination run, take the 10-minute ‘bumboat’ ride from Changi Point to Pulau Ubin Island. The island is a large nature sanctuary featuring wetlands, mangrove swamps, and lush, wooded trails. There’s a variety of wide, easy trails, and some trickier hiking/trail running options. A few favorite areas for running are below. TRAIL MAP

Wetlands & Quarry Loop. 5 km. Located at the eastern end of the island, this is one of the more scenic runs on Pulau Ubin. Start with a 1 km loop of the Ckek Jawa Wetlands, including the scenic boardwalk. Then, run the trail out to the Balai Quarry Viewpoint, looping back along Jln Sam Heng & Jln Durian Rd., to the lush trail passing the Common Pulai Heritage Tree.  ROUTE MAP

Ketam Quarry Area. Mainly wooded trails around this quarry. It’s also a popular mountain biking area. You can also take the trail out to the northwest tip of the island. The trails in this area are more rugged.

Island Roads. The island roads are also runnable, and are a good option if you don’t want to do the trails. Note that there’s no shoulder or sidewalk along the roads, but there’s very little traffic. Most of the roads are interior and fairly wooded.
