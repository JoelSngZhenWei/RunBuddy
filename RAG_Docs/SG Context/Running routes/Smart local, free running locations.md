Free running tracks in Singapore
There are many ways to get into the groove of the #fitspo life in SG – think cycling, hiking and an outdoor excursion to our many nature parks like Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. But if you thrive on lacing up the track shoes, these free running tracks in Singapore may be what you need to iron up your stamina with zero distractions.

What are the benefits of running?
While you might already know how useful running is when it comes to losing weight, there are many other benefits you may not know about from improving mental health to reducing risks of certain health issues.

In general, every 1km run is equivalent to 60 calories burned, though this varies on many factors like age and intensity of the run. For those focusing on weight loss, aim to get your heart rate into the fat-burning zone, which is about 70%-80% of your maximum heart rate. To get your approximate maximum heart rate, multiply your age by 0.7 before subtracting it from 208.

Other pros of running include positive impacts on your mental health. When we run or exercise, endorphins and other chemicals like serotonin and dopamine – happy hormones, are released which reduce the feeling of stress and anxiety. Running also helps to regulate sleep patterns and increases sleep quality by keeping the circadian rhythm in check.

In the long run, running can significantly reduce your risk of illnesses and diseases like osteoporosis, diabetes, stroke, and even cancer.

How to increase your running stamina?
When it comes to building up stamina, take it slow and easy by following a progressive training plan. This means gradually increasing the distance you run weekly by about 10% each week. You can also try incorporating longer runs at a slower pace to get your body used to the distance.

How to prepare for a run?
Being in the proper attire can improve performance and reduce the chances of injury, so make sure you’ve got appropriate running gear. Here are some essentials you’ll need:
