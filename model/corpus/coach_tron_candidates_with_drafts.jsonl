If choosing cross-training, opt for a low-impact activity in the early afternoon\n\n**Day 4:**\n- Run: 5 km easy (60-70% of your normal pace) in the late morning\n- Hydrate more than usual, focusing on water and electrolytes\n- Post-run stretch: Include some dynamic stretches to help with recovery and prevent stiffness\n\n**Day 5:**\n- Long run: 10 km (70-80% of your normal pace), aiming for a negative split (slower in the first half, faster in the second)\n- Hydrate throughout the long run, focusing on electrolytes and sodium intake\n- Post-run stretch: Focus on full body stretches to aid recovery and prevent tightness\n\n**General Tips:**\n- Avoid heavy meals before runs, opt for light snacks instead\n- Wear lightweight, breathable clothing during runs\n- Run in the heat", "meta": {"source": "kaggle_mexwell_running_logs", "created": "2025-10-17", "weekly_km": 21.6, "days_run": 3, "long_run_km": 10.24, "pace_min_per_km": 4.92, "country": "Mexico", "age_group": "18 - 34", "gender": "M", "draft_source": "ollama:mistral:instruct", "draft_status": "ok", "approved": false}}

In the hours leading up to the race, consume 400-600ml of fluid containing electrolytes (sports drink or homemade) every 30 minutes.\n\n**During-Race Hydration Plan**\n1. Take in 200-400mg of sodium per hour through sports drinks, gels, or salty snacks. Adjust based on sweat rate and taste preference.\n2. Consume 300-500ml of fluid every 15 minutes during the run, adjusting for individual thirst and weather conditions.\n3. Use a hydration system that allows for easy access and consumption (e.g., handheld water bottle, belt with bottles, or hydration vest).\n4. Consider using electrolyte gels or salty snacks (pretzels, sports beans) to maintain sodium levels.\n5. Start hydration strategy early, ideally from the beginning of the race to avoid dehydration.\n\n**Post-Race Hydration Plan**\n1. Immediately after finishing the race, consume 800-1200ml of fluid (water or sports drink) in the first 30 minutes to rehydrate and replenish electrolytes.\n2. Continue hydrating every 15-30 minutes over the next few hours with fluids containing electrolytes.\n\n**Gel Timing**\n1. Start consuming gels after the first hour of running, approximately every 30-45 minutes.\n2. Choose gels that are easy on the stomach and contain electrolytes (aim for 200-400mg sodium per gel).\n3.
