If choosing cross-training, opt for a low-impact activity in the early afternoon\n\n**Day 4:**\n- Run: 5 km easy (60-70% of your normal pace) in the late morning\n- Hydrate more than usual, focusing on water and electrolytes\n- Post-run stretch: Include some dynamic stretches to help with recovery and prevent stiffness\n\n**Day 5:**\n- Long run: 10 km (70-80% of your normal pace), aiming for a negative split (slower in the first half, faster in the second)\n- Hydrate throughout the long run, focusing on electrolytes and sodium intake\n- Post-run stretch: Focus on full body stretches to aid recovery and prevent tightness\n\n**General Tips:**\n- Avoid heavy meals before runs, opt for light snacks instead\n- Wear lightweight, breathable clothing during runs\n- Run in the heat", "meta": {"source": "kaggle_mexwell_running_logs", "created": "2025-10-17", "weekly_km": 21.6, "days_run": 3, "long_run_km": 10.24, "pace_min_per_km": 4.92, "country": "Mexico", "age_group": "18 - 34", "gender": "M", "draft_source": "ollama:mistral:instruct", "draft_status": "ok", "approved": false}}
